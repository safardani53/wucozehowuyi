It is terrifying.”</p><p>The ghost expert believes this girl's spirit may be a child who died from diphtheria in the 1800s as the disease made the under eyes appear sunken and dark.</p><p>Another intriguing theory is this ghost has not been able to move into the afterlife because she has unfinished business.</p><p>Some believe she was murdered by a serial killer called Raymond Morris - who killed three children in the same area between 1954 and 1967.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>But many people believe it is a hoax and say locals dress up deliberately to scare walkers and keep the legend alive.</p><p>However, a group of teenagers claim to have spotted the spirit in 2021 when they went camping.</p><p>Of the experience, they told<a href=# aria-label=" Birmingham Live (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Birmingham Live</a>: “I was absolutely terrified.</p><p>"I’d read the stories in the news about the black-eyed child, but it wasn’t until the thing stood right in front of me that I could quite believe them.</p><p>“I knew instantly that we were dealing with the real thing because it moved in ways humans simply can’t move.</p><p>"It was like it could teleport from one place to another when it was moving around and hiding behind the trees.”</p><p>The group also saw the little girl the next morning looking at them with her dark eyes from behind a tree.</p><p>Lee Brickley, another supernatural activity expert, told the <a href=# aria-label="Daily Star (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Daily Star</a>: “There was also another incident in October 2019 when a young girl chased after the black eyed child near Castle Ring, and again, she was unable to catch up with her.</p><p>"The girl involved ran through the trees following the black eyed child until she reached a sheer cliff-edge drop of around twenty feet.</p><p>"Had she not managed to slow her pace and avoid the fall, the girl would have come to serious harm."</p><p>Lee Brickley also claimed to have <a href=#>found giant 16 inch footprints in Staffordshire</a> - and considered them proof of the <a href=#>Sasquatch</a> legend.</p><p>The 34-year-old said the ferocious claw marks could only belong to Big Foot.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>He claims the tracks were found at Gentleshaw Common after an anonymous fellow hunter tipped him off.</p><p>Lee says the print measured 16.1 inches from heel to toe - the equivalent of a UK size 25.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ35zhJZsbHJnkqGupLeMnrCenF2ctrO4jKCfqKukYsKsedKtmJ%2Ben6extLTIq5xo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
