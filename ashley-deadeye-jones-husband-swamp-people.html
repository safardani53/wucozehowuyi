It was like I was meant to do something else."&nbsp;</p><p>Chad noticed the change in his wife’s demeanor. "I just remember sitting at the kitchen table and my husband said, 'I don't remember the last time I saw you smile, much less laugh,'" Ashley recalled. "He said, 'I'm going to take you deer hunting this afternoon.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>That outing ignited a fire inside Ashley that she didn’t know existed.

The fishing enthusiast connected with Ronnie on the platform and signed up for one of his wild hog hunts in New Orleans.</p><p>"[Chad and I] went down there and hog-hunted and really got along [with Ronnie]," Ashley told the Clarion Ledger. "He's the kind of person that when you meet him the first time, you're like family."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Ronnie was so impressed with Ashley’s skills — her nickname "Deadeye" stems from her impeccable shot — that he recommended her for Swamp People when producers came knocking.
