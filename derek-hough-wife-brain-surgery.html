While you can’t see Hayley’s face, you can see she’s wearing protective headgear. Hopefully, this surgery will mean she no longer has to wear the helmet. Still, Derek explained that they are being realistic.</p><p>“Her recovery process has been nothing short of a miracle,” he explained. “She still has a ways to go with another surgery, hopefully in a few weeks, to insert a skull implant to replace the piece that was removed during the craniectomy. It will restore the skull to its natural shape and protect the brain from injury.:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1498576860-1-2-732x1024.jpg><h2 id=h-derek-hough-s-wife-hayley-rushed-to-the-hospital-after-show-for-emergency-surgery>Derek Hough’s Wife Hayley Rushed To The Hospital After Show For Emergency Surgery</h2><p>On Thursday December 7, the Dancing with the Stars judge, 38, announced on his <a href=#>Instagram</a> that his wife was rushed into emergency surgery and was being treated for a cranial hematoma. “At the end of last night’s tour performance in Washington, D.C., my wife Hayley became disoriented and was taken to the hospital,” he wrote. “She was diagnosed with a cranial hematoma from a burst blood vessel and required an emergency craniectomy. She is in stable condition.”</p><p>A cranial hematoma is when blood collects in the skull and although we don’t know how the condition developed for Derek’s beloved, it’s good news indeed to hear that she’s stable under terrifying circumstances.</p><p>“I want to thank the first responders and medical personnel who have cared for and continue to care for her. I ask for your prayers and positivity during this time,” he added.</p><p>A trying moment for the newlyweds, who just this summer got married on August 26, just before their tour kicked off in late September. Shortly after posting about the news, fellow DWTS fam members like Jenna Johnson, Peta Murgatroyd, and Ariana Madix were sending their love to the pair.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s hoping for a speedy recovery, Hayley!</p><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2trX2Z%2FcLDEq5ykZZikwqi0jLCgn51dl7%2Bitc1mqq6ql5q%2Funs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
