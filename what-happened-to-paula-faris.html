As she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Housekeeping</a>, her life turned completely upside down in the months leading up to her departure.&nbsp;</p><p>"I went from a period of seven months where I had a miscarriage, [and] I had a concussion — someone threw something at my head when I was doing a live shot and that knocked me out of work for three weeks," she explained.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>"[Then] the day I got cleared to go to work, I got in a head-on car crash. A couple of months later I got influenza, and influenza turned into pneumonia," she added.&nbsp;</p><p>Paula interpreted the seemingly unending stream of unfortunate events as a sign telling her to forge change in her life, and she decided to quit her roles at The View and Good Morning America Weekends at the same time.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>In part, the decision was fueled by the need to take a break. More importantly, however, she wanted to spend more time focusing on her own projects, like the Journeys of Faith with Paula Faris podcast. As a Christian television host, Paula experienced firsthand the difficulty of discussing topics related to faith and religion in a news environment.</p><p>As she told Good Housekeeping, she was hoping to create a space where people could openly talk about their religious beliefs.&nbsp;As she explained, most approach this topic with a sense of caution, as they are worried that voicing their opinions might offend others.&nbsp;</p><p>Since its launch, Journeys of Faith with Paula Faris featured prominent guests like Sabrina the Teenage Witch alum Melissa Joan Hart or musician Michael W.

And, I’ve struggled with how to tell you about it, not wanting to appear tone deaf as so many have lost so much to this crisis: sense of purpose, loved ones, jobs, belongings, wealth. We’ve all lost something. Some more than others. “CALLED OUT: Why I Traded Two Dream Jobs for a Life of True Calling” is all about finding our significance in the *wrong* things and how to discover true, unshakable calling. For me, my significance was my job. And, it took a personal crisis to get my attention. I bought society’s lie that my value was my vocation, my worth was work, my calling was career. I leaned in hard. I burned out. Then, after I walked away from my two dream jobs (anchoring GMA and co-hosting The View), I felt lost. Who was I without it? I didn’t know who I was outside of what I did. This book is not just my experience, it’s full of interviews with and observations of others struggling with the same sense of misplaced significance, identity and purpose. I hope this book encourages you to root into your true purpose and discover your true calling, which will help you navigate this season of crisis. Thank you so much for giving it a shot! (You can pre-order, now. See link in bio.) #CalledOutBook.</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Paula Faris</a> (@paulafaris) on Apr 6, 2020 at 6:44am PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Paula's new book, 'Called Out,' came out on April 21, 2020.</h2><p>In addition to the podcast, Paula also took on a new role as a senior national correspondent at ABC News in the autumn of 2018.
