She affirmed the rocker made every day great and reinstated that she was the luckiest girl in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>In 2021, she appeared in Radke's song<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> 'I am Not Vanpire (revamped).'</a></p><h2>Ronnie Radke's Daughter Willow Grace Radke&nbsp;</h2><p>Radke's daughter Wilow&nbsp;Grace Radke is into music and plays piano.&nbsp;</p><p>She has her own <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Facebook account</a> with numerous pictures showcasing her lovely time spent with her father.</p><p><img alt height=400 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodmask.com/uploads/images/hmalbum/Ronnie-Radke-Daughter.jpg width=600 ezimgfmt="rs rscb1 src ng ngcb1" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Willow was born in 2013—in this time period, her father, Ronnie Radke was in a relationship with Southern Charm reality star <a href=# rel="follow noopener">Jenna King</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Why was Saraya's Boyfriend Ronnie Radke put in Jail?</h2><p>The same year in 2022, Saraya also got into controversy for <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">joking with her boyfriend Radke</a> about something that could easily be linked to&nbsp;his past conviction.</p><p>In a video she uploaded to TikTok, she is seen smilingly watching her boyfriend pretending&nbsp;to stab someone repeatedly while the Britney Spear song 'Mama, I'm In Love With a Criminal' played in the background.</p><p>If you didn't know, he was previously sentenced to prison in violation of his probation that he got in a case of the killing of Michael Allen Cook&nbsp;on 6 May 2006 in the desert at the north end of Decatur Boulevard near Shadow High School.&nbsp;</p><p>What happened was then 22-year-old old Radke participated in a group-vs-group&nbsp;brawl-led shooting.</p><p>According to the police, the probable cause of the shooting was a dispute that resulted in the shooting of two people including Cook.&nbsp;</p><p>The preliminary report said that the incident involved seven people in their late teens and early twenties.&nbsp;</p><p>As per the report, Radke and Cook's friend Marcel Colquitt had an agreement to meet to settle their dispute once and for all.</p><p>On the day of the incident, Radke and his three identified accomplices, including Cook's 22-year-old shooter Chase Rader, Joseph Rader, and Jack Rader, met in the desert with Marcel Colquitt, who was there with brother Michael and the homicide victim Cook.</p><p>However, the situation got intense as they started discussing the dispute after which Michael Colquitt took out a gun. It was Michael Colquitt who drew out a revolver on Jospeh Rader first.&nbsp;</p><p>Joesepth, in return, was successful in keeping the gun away from Michael Colquitt, who was aided by&nbsp;Michael Cook.&nbsp;</p><p>During the intense moment,&nbsp;Chase Rader fired at Michael Colquitt and Michael Cook.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident resulted in the death of 18-year-old Michael Allen Cook as Rader fired his gun. Michael was also seriously injured.&nbsp;</p><p>Later,&nbsp;Radke felt responsible for Cook's death and&nbsp;admitted that he had a hand in setting up the brawl.</p><p>Still, the district attorney said he wouldn't prosecute him because his case was that of self-defense—the claim Cook's shooter Rader also had made.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Bur Radke was overwhelmed by the situation and pleaded guilty to one charge of battery with substantial bodily harm.&nbsp;</p><p>The court sentenced him to&nbsp;<strong>five years in probation and asked him to pay $92,372 to Cook's mother Ceda Freeman</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Rader, despite shooting the victim, didn't get any charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Talking from inside his 12-by-14-foot cell to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Las Vegas</a> Sun in October 2008, Radke revealed his version of the story different from the police report.</p><p>He claimed that the Colquitt brothers provoked him into a brawl when he confronted them to stop threatening to beat his longtime friend Maxwell Grenne, who he described as a "smaller guy."&nbsp;</p><p>He said he was the only one prosecuted because of his "fame."</p><p>He revealed,&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I mean, my friend [Chase Rader, who fired his gun at Cook] saved my life, dude, and I don’t think he deserves any jail time, either. Yeah, of course we [Radke and Chase and Joe Rader] went there to fight, but … they started it … and if it wasn’t for [Radke’s longtime friend] Maxwell Greene, that fight would never have happened. I mean, I always stick up for Max, he’s a smaller guy, and I’d always be his bigger brother, you know, people would have to come through me first to get to him. But [brothers Michael and Marcel Colquitt, who had been threatening to beat up Greene until Radke intervened] started calling me and harassing me, saying they were going to come to my house and murder me. Then they started calling me “pussy” and this and that if I don’t show up to fight them. So I go there … and they had about 12 people with them, and we had four people. They ran up, pulled a gun out, fired it, my friend Joe Rader grabbed the gun, [Chase’s] gun went off three more times, and Chase gets self-defense, and that’s how I get stuck with the bag.</p><p>Similarly, Marcel Colquitt also claimed in an interview that Chase Rader pulled his gun first.</p><p>In August of 2008, then Escape the Fate artist Radke&nbsp;was sentenced to two and half years in <a href=# rel="follow noopener">prison</a> for violating his probation.&nbsp;</p><p>In his experience, the probation was a "recipe for disaster."</p><p>He retrospected, "The courts gave me a recipe for disaster. They said I’d have to pay $93,000 in restitution, $30 a month to the probation officers, $30 a month to a drug counselor, $30 a month for impulse control, and I’m not allowed to tour with my band, and I’d have to get a real job."</p><p>He added, "So I said, 'F*ck you.'&nbsp;I mean, what else was I supposed to do? I even tried to get a job as a bartender, but I have a felony, so they didn’t give me my sheriff’s card. So I tried, but with the drugs piling onto me and with the depression getting so much worse, there’s only so much a person can take."</p><h2>What is Ronnie Radke's Net Worth?</h2><p>Radke, who stands at the height of 6 feet and 1 inch,&nbsp;has an estimated net worth of $4 million, according to<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> Celebritynetworth</a>.</p><h2>How Old is Ronnie Radke?</h2><p>Radke was born as Ronald Joseph Radke on 15&nbsp;December 1983 (age 39) in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. to father Russell Radke and drug-addicted mother (name unrevealed).</p><p>He was born as one of three children to parents who didn't raise the kids together.
