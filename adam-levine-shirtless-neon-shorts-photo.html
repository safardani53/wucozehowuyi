The Maroon 5 singer and former&nbsp;The Voice&nbsp;coach only wore a pair of neon yellow shorts and light blue sneakers. His many tattoos were also on full-display as he prepared to work out. Of course, Adam had to stay hydrated and carried a bottle of Essentia water with him.&nbsp; Adam was accompanied by his live-in, personal trainer,<strong> Austin Pohlen,&nbsp;</strong>for the gym outing. Austin also went shirtless, sporting only a pair of gray shorts, but it did look like he might have had a t-shirt tucked into the back of his waistband.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adam-levine-working-out-shirtless-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>Maybe it’s just the summer heat, but Adam definitely seems fond of working out shirtless! He posted an Instagram Story of himself getting some <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>kettle bell and medicine ball exercises</a> in while he was vacationing in Hawaii with his wife, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Behati Prinsloo</strong></a>, and their two daughters:&nbsp;<strong>Dusty Rose&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Gio Grace,&nbsp;</strong>on June 8. Of course, Adam still got plenty of quality time with his family and was seen <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>taking a dip in the ocean</a> with his wife on the same trip.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Even when he’s not working out shirtless, Adam has been keeping very busy lately. He released&nbsp;Jordi, his seventh studio album with his band Maroon 5 on June 11. The record was a star-studded affair, boasting collaborations with “Savage” rapper <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Megan Thee Stallion</a>,&nbsp;</strong>iconic rock singer <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Stevie Nicks</a>,&nbsp;</strong>and many more. The album also featured posthumous contributions from rappers&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Juice Wrld </strong></a>and&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Nipsey Hussle. </strong></a>Perhaps Adam’s been working out so much, because Maroon 5 is set to kick off a summer tour on August 10!? Rapper <strong>Blackbear,&nbsp;</strong>who also makes a guest appearance on Jordi, is set to open the tour.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/adam-levine-working-out-shirtless-backgrid-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Before the new album dropped, Adam <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>returned to&nbsp;The Voice</a> to perform the hit song “Beautiful Mistakes” alongside his Maroon 5 bandmates. Adam rocked pink hair and a tropical shirt for the appearance on his old show. The performance was the first time the ex-coach had returned to the show since he’d <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>left in 2019</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH14e49qZpqckaJ6rbHVoqWeZaOdtrPAy56qrGWemryvedKhpquso2K9qbvTqGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
