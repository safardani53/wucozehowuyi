I’ve never given him advice about women – I think it would be too oppressive for his old man to give him that kind of advice,” Willem told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Guardian</a>&nbsp;in 2009. “He’s got to find his own way; I can’t help him. I teach by example.
