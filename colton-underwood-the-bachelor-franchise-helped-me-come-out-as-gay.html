After the reality star, 29, <a href=#>came out as gay</a> during a Wednesday, April 14, interview on Good Morning America, he reflected on the franchise.</p><p>“Do I regret being the Bachelor? Do I regret handling it the way that I did? I do think I could have handled it better, I’ll say that,” he shared with journalist <a href=#><strong>Robin Roberts</strong></a>. “I just wish I wouldn’t have dragged people into my own mess of figuring out who I was. I genuinely mean that.”</p><p>The former NFL player also wanted to thank every woman who joined his season of <a href=#>The Bachelor</a>, which aired in 2019.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Colton-Underwood-Shares-How-The-Bachelor-Helped-Him-Come-Out-2.jpg><p>“At the same time, I can sit here and say I’m sorry to all of those women, I can also say thank you,” the Colton Underwood Legacy Foundation founder said. “Without them and without the Bachelor franchise, I don’t know if this would have ever came out.”</p><p>When Underwood first appeared on Bachelor Nation during<a href=#><strong> Becca Kufrin</strong></a>‘s season, he made headlines after revealing that he was a virgin — a label <a href=#>that stuck with him</a> throughout his time as the Bachelor.</p><p>“I could never give anybody a good enough answer about why I was a virgin. The truth is I was ‘the virgin Bachelor’ because I was gay, and I didn’t know how to handle that,” he told Roberts, 60, during Wednesday’s interview. “I put myself in really bad situations on purpose. I put myself in these situations so I could try to force myself to be straight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Colton-Underwood-Shares-How-The-Bachelor-Helped-Him-Come-Out.jpg><p>The First Time author also wanted fans to know that he’s “<a href=#>still the same Colton everybody met</a> on TV,” despite finally owning his true self.</p><p>“I’m still the same Colton to my friends and my family, I just happen to be able to share with people now all of me,” he added. “And I<a href=#> am proud of that,</a> you know? I am proud to be gay.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Following the interview, Bachelor producers shared their support for Underwood.</p><p>“We are so inspired by Colton Underwood’s courage to embrace and pursue his authentic self,” the team at ABC and Warner Bros. said in a statement. “As firm believers in the power of love, we celebrate Colton’s journey in the LGBTQIA+ community every step of the way.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqopKSku27BzZ2cq6%2BfpLFuwMeeZJuZk52yrbvRZp2rmZ6Ytaq%2FxGafnqSgmrFuucRmmqillWK8tsCMmqpmn5GufA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
