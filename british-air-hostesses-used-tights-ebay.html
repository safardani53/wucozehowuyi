You can get £50 for a used pair of shoes and tights sell as well."</p><p>The ads can easily be found online, with listings asking for anywhere between £3 and £20 for a pair of used tights.</p><p>One current listing states: "Used uniform cabin crew flight attendant tights. Condition is used. Wore for many air miles."</p><p>Another has a photo of a woman in a mini skirt wearing laddered tights, alongside a photo of a British Airways cabin crew badge as a means of proving her position.</p><p>And old shoes are just as popular, with one scuffed pair selling for £74.99 and described as "well travelled and showing some signs of wear and tear".</p><p>eBay has cracked down on the sale of such items in recent years, but sellers will try to find loopholes in order to keep selling their wares.</p><p>One listing has no photo and simply writes out the full email address - "naughty trolly dolly at outlook dot com" - in the item description.</p><p>It comes after a <a href=#>male Norwegian Airline steward said one of his colleagues was offered £300 for a photo of her wearing the outfit being sold.</a></p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN NEWS</h2></p><p>A spokesman for Manchester Airport said that as cabin crews are employed by airlines it would not be relevant for them to comment.</p><p>A spokesman for British Airways said: "We expect the highest standards of behaviour from all our colleagues."</p><p>An eBay spokesman added: “For health and hygiene reasons, we don't allow the sale of used underwear on site.
