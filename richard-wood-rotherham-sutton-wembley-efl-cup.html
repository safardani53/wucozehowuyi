The Rotherham captain was the hero as his two goals in the 2018 League One play-off final fired them into the Championship.
His youngest son Graye has watched over and again the video of the 2-1 win over Shrewsbury after extra-time.
Today League One Millers face League Two Sutton in the Papa John’s Trophy Final.
And defender Wood, 36, told SunSport: “The main thing that sticks in my mind and a lot of it is a blur looking back."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He has literally learned the entire commentary of both my goals — he can say it word for word.&nbsp;</p><p>“And he and his older brother Jenson, who is 13, are so excited to be going back.

Don’t spend too much nervous energy. Too much is bad. Enjoy it for what it is.&nbsp;</p><p>“Not too many people get to play at Wembley. So you must take advantage of that feeling and enjoy it.</p><p>“But after the warm up and you do all the bits before, I just focus on the game then.</p><p>“You must put your heart and soul into it and give everything you’ve got.</p><p>“You visualise what you want to happen on the day and for me it was just to get promoted. I never thought about scoring, let alone getting two!”</p><p>Sharing those special moments with loved ones are a huge motivation for Wood when he steps out onto the pitch every week.</p><p>And he said: “It’s why I want my family and children to watch me play right to the end of my career and create new memories.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/45a0aa90-b24d-4dba-9ef6-232d902d3dc8.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/637e6027-38af-408e-a6b3-a86b82118df9.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/RTRMADP_SOCCER-ENGLAND-RTU-SHT_447139333_RC189EC2D320_2018-05-27T162522Zjpg-JS409248107.jpg><p>“Football is of course rewarding and well paid. But for me it’s about scoring goals, winning matches, playing at Wembley, getting promoted. To play there is something I will treasure and it’s a moment I know they will all remember for the rest of their lives too.”</p><p>Standing in his and Rotherham’s way today is League Two club Sutton, who only won promotion from the National League this summer.</p><p>A bit like Rotherham, they are a club that feels it is punching above its weight but continue to be well run and are progressing while more glamorous clubs are faltering.</p><p>Wood said: “They are a good side and deserve to be here. They’ve been the underdogs and I admire any team like that which clearly have a real togetherness.&nbsp;</p><p>“Even though we’re in different leagues, that doesn’t come into my thought process.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>“We’ve been watching them and how they play — and it’s irrelevant what league they’re in, we’ll be treating them exactly the same as we would any other team, higher division, same division or lower.</p><p>“It’s a football match and whoever turns up on the day usually wins.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqynqKqkZH55fZNtb25oX6e2pLTAq5tmr5%2BksW6%2Bzq2fnqqYlrpuv9Stq6imXayyrq7LnrBmnZaheqTBz2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
