His joke was in reference to a viral video from Venice, where fans thought that Harry was spitting on Chris as he sat down next to him at the premiere screening of their upcoming movie.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Harry Styles: "It's wonderful, wonderful, wonderful to be back in New York. I just popped very quickly to Venice to spit on Chris Pine." <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/TUGOSoQPxw</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-3>— CONSEQUENCE (@consequence) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 8, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Fans went absolutely wild in the crowd of Harry’s Madison Square Garden show, and immediately, clips of the hilarious joke made their way to social media. Harry is currently in the midst of a short residency at Madison Square Garden, and has been playing shows in the midst of promoting&nbsp;Don’t Worry Darling. He stars in the movie alongside&nbsp;<strong>Florence Pugh</strong>, as well as <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>his girlfriend</a>,&nbsp;<strong>Olivia Wilde</strong>, who is also the movie’s director.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Chris pine just wondered where his sunglasses were after the applause. And he zoned out (likes he’s been doing all day) and realised it’s in his lap. So I am sorry to say harry styles did not spit on him. <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>pic.twitter.com/7b4GoCvnHJ</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>— priscilla (@cinemazietgeist) <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>September 6, 2022</a></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>A source close to Chris previously told <strong>HollywoodLife </strong>that Harry “100% did not spit on/at” Chris and added that the encounter “is a completely fabricated exchange and any suggestion otherwise is a blatant attempt to create drama that simply does not exist.” The viral video came amidst rumors of issues amongst the cast of&nbsp;Don’t Worry Darling, which were fueled by the distance kept between Harry, Olivia and Florence at the premiere. The trio were always separated by other cast members while posing for photos on the carpet, with Harry and Olivia not even standing next to each other in photos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>However, a source told&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY that Harry and Olivia were purposely kept apart in order to keep the focus of the day <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on the movie</a>, as opposed to their relationship. The two started dating while they were filming the movie in the fall of 2020, right around the same time that Olivia split from&nbsp;<strong>Jason Sudeikis</strong>. Meanwhile, Olivia has avoided commenting on any rumors of tension between herself and Florence, while Florence has kept tight-lipped about the situation in general.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e49wZqGZoqfGbr%2FTsqOeq12nsqKv06xkq62dpL9uts6knKxlo6W2tcDIp55mm5intrR5z6Klnmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
