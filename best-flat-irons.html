We asked testers with different hair types (thin, fine, wavy, thick, and curly) to try some of the best-selling flat irons and record their insights throughout the process. Our testers took note of how smooth the glide felt, how many passes it took to get their hair straight, and how easy the iron was to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Along with our in-depth testing, we also spoke to hair stylists, including Kelly and beauty expert Nick Stenson, who’s smoothed the hair of countless celebrities and created picture-perfect styles for numerous runway shows. “It’s equally important to me that the flat iron works well with all hair types and offers versatility,” Stenson tells PEOPLE.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We used a meat thermometer to test the maximum heat, a ruler to verify the cord lengths, and a stopwatch to time how long each iron took to heat up and shut off automatically. We also tested durability by dropping each iron twice at vanity level to see if it would break, chip, or scratch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With so much styling potential, there are dozens upon dozens of flat irons to choose from and a lot to consider when shopping for the best one for your hair type — which is why we sent our PEOPLE Tested team on a mission to find the flat irons that can achieve the slickest and straightest finishes and most effortless waves and curls.&nbsp;After testing dozens of models, we landed on 12 flat irons for every hair type and concern.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Keep reading to discover the best flat irons, tested and reviewed by PEOPLE.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-babylisspro-nano-titanium-dual-ionic-flat-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Overall</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Dual Ionic Flat Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="BaBylissPRO Nano Titanium Dual Ionic Flat Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/1AynGa6uD1jPdycXOzYtE11zI2A=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/BaBylissPRO-Nano-Titanium-Dual-Ionic-Flat-Iron-c33bc4f35cca48638c2933eedb9a8e33.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>BaBylissPRO</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Temperature gauge is specifically designed for different hair types</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Features ions for a more customized style for your hair type and needs</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Has a lightweight design that makes it easier to handle while styling</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Works better at curling than most other flat irons we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Our top pick for the best flat iron is the BabylissPRO Nano Titanium Dual Ionic Flat Iron. Taking only 20 seconds to heat up, this hair straightener is designed with titanium plates and features ion technology that you can turn on and off, depending on your hair type and needs. Technically, this flat iron is designed for all hair types, especially those with thick and coarse hair; however, we found that it actually is better for fine and wavy hair, since it was a bit tricky to use on thick strands during our testing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Nonetheless, we were impressed overall by this mid-range straightener and appreciated that it was lightweight and easy to use. On top of that, it heats up quickly and features five different temperature settings designed for specific hair types, so you don’t have to worry about causing damage to strands. Our in-lab expert even said that this flat iron was one of the best for curling — so it's truly a multi-functional tool.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature Settings: </strong>5 | <strong>Width: </strong>1.25 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-user-friendly-dyson-corrale-hair-straightener></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best User-Friendly</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Corrale</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dyson Corrale Straightener Styling Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/dy60CFiy8JXqtbW54jV4HDkDUGs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dyson-corrale-straightener-styling-iron-3a4f5054f135476c9e90dc85ac2a903a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dyson</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2.5><li readability=-1><p>Cord-free design makes it easier to maneuver while styling</p></li><li readability=0><p>Uses far less heat compared to traditional straighteners, helping to decrease damage</p></li><li readability=0><p>Super easy to curl and straighten hair, even for beginners</p></li><li readability=0><p>Comes with a gorgeous storage case, which is especially helpful when traveling</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For the price of this iron, you might expect high quality and up-to-the-minute technology — and you'd be right. The Dyson Corrale flat iron features unique flexing copper alloy plates that conform to the shape of your hair to straighten it in less time and produce less damage. Even on curly type 4 hair, the Dyson iron straightened the hair in one pass. For straighter hair, the Dyson also excelled with one pass, leaving no static at low temperatures of 365 degrees. Speaking of benefits, this iron can be used cordless for up to 32 minutes (we tested it until the battery ran out), making it more practical than ever to style your hair on the go.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Despite its portability, the tool is pretty heavy. Though its weight (1.32 lbs., to be exact) doesn't initially seem heavy, after some time with your arms up straightening your hair, you start to feel those extra ounces. During our lab tests, the iron took 35 seconds to heat up to the maximum temperature and turned off automatically after five minutes of not being used — which is especially great because it preserves battery life. As far as durability goes, there was no damage at all after dropping the iron a couple of times.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, this fast-heating flat iron offers salon-quality styling for all hair types, so if you're looking to invest in a durable and smart hair tool, we think that the Dyson lives up to (and surpasses) all of its hype.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature Settings: </strong>3 | <strong>Width: </strong>1 inch | <strong>Material:</strong> Copper alloy</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-natural-hair-tymo-ring-plus></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Natural Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Tymo Ring Plus</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="TYMO Ring Plus" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/oYzCvmQTNpY9ZavmCvxlHUm3tEE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/tymo-ring-plus-312b211fad404d7c92e9a01d49428fd3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>TYMO</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.9</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=1><p>One of the least expensive options we tried, but feels high quality with an innovative design that's great for multiple hair types</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Combing teeth on plate help to straighten and smooth curly and coily textures</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For straightening hair without any static, the TYMO Ring Plus can't be beaten. Unlike typical flat-plate straighteners, the TYMO Ring's plates have small ridges that comb through the hair while you pass it through so that it both detangles and smoothes the hair at the same time. The teeth are coated with nano titanium which helps to ensure even heat distribution and use ions to further seal in the smoothness. The combing teeth are especially useful in straightening curly and coily natural hair textures. Because of the comb-like teeth, though, those with tangle-prone hair might find that it tugs uncomfortably. To mitigate any potential pulling, we recommend coming through your hair with a standard brush or comb before going in with the hot tool.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This hot tool offers nine different heat settings that range from 250 to 410 degrees, making it more customizable than many of the other tools we tried in the same price range. We found that this tool is strictly for straightening — it didn't do us any favors when we tried to use it for curling different types of hair. However, it's not marketed as a tool for curling, so we only recommend if you're needing something to just straighten your hair. Overall, this is a fantastic option for straight and sleek styles that's a bit more affordable than others we tested.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature Settings: </strong>9 | <strong>Width: </strong>2.76 inches | <strong>Material:</strong> Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wet-to-dry-dyson-airstrait-straightener></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wet-to-Dry</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dyson Airstrait Straightener</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Ulta Dyson Airstrait Straightener" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XZ-xcwobr_gt_a2RD58nrbYq20w=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Dyson-Airstrait-Straightener-9abb3c77107f4ae8ad30ade04dfeb328.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Ulta</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=-1><p>Concentrated air technology dries and straightens hair in one pass</p></li><li readability=0><p>Left our medium-thick hair smooth and shiny in half the time it would usually take to blow dry and straighten</p></li><li readability=0><p>Gave us a straight style that wasn’t flat, with a bit of natural movement</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Remember when we used to fry our strands by passing traditional straighteners over damp hair? Luckily, those days are long behind us and that hair damage is staying in the early 2000s where it belongs — because the Dyson Airstraight gave us a sleek style from wet to dry in 15 minutes without damaging our hair. The two-in-one device uses concentrated air to dry and smooth down hair, which means no need for damaging hot plates. Our medium-thick, wavy hair was left smooth, straight, and glossy after using the Dyson Airstrait.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With the Dyson Airstraight in hand, we were able to simultaneously blow dry and straighten large sections of hair at a time, which cut our styling time in half. The device is equipped with an auto-pause feature that automatically stops the airflow after three seconds of inactivity, which prevents you from overheating any section of the hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the price tag might have initially inspired a dose of sticker shock, we think that the expeditious, shiny style that we were able to achieve with just this one tool (no need for a blow dryer and separate straightener) makes it worth the price if you’re willing to invest in a high-quality, truly innovative flat iron.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Plate width:</strong> 1.5 inches | <strong>Plate type:</strong> Plateless concentrated air technology with smoothing negative ions | <strong>Voltage:</strong> 120V | <strong>Cord length:</strong> 9.6 feet</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-curly-hair-hot-tools-pro-signature-steamstyler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Curly Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Hot Tools Pro Signature SteamStyler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Target Hot Tools Pro Signature SteamStyler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/WVmVIlO3gkCrh2eJdRChiHCFKyA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Hot-Tools-Pro-Signature-SteamStyler-214dfb8c14d845e0bdfc19e24ced4b70.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Target</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=-1><p>Straightener glides through hair easily without any pulling or tugging</p></li><li readability=0><p>Not only straightens, but also leaves hair looking super shiny after styling</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Under $100 for a professional-worthy straightener</p></li><li readability=0><p>Features a wider plate, making it easier to straighten curly strands</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have curly hair, we loved the Hot Tools Pro Signature SteamStyler, which features three steam settings for a more efficient straightening effect.

While this might not be a concern for all, it did take us a while to straighten our strands, which makes us wish that the flat iron’s shut-off time was a little longer.

While we liked the overall curling effect, we would love to see this straightener with slightly longer plates to make curling a little bit easier — however, this issue wasn’t a deal-breaker for us, and we still think it's a high-quality tool for the price.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature Settings: </strong>5 | <strong>Width: </strong>Two 0.5-inch plates | <strong>Material:</strong> Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-fine-hair-lange-le-duo-360-airflow-titanium-styler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best for Fine Hair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'ange Le Duo</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon L'ange Le Duo 360 Airflow Styler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/KmoOIULgUA_4ayr9yP-TkQDy9RM=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Lange-Le-Duo-360-Airflow-Styler-512af46c20234c50847329ef7256611e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.7</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>Features air vents that cool hair and seal curls</p></li><li readability=0><p>Costs less than $100, which is less expensive than most flat irons we tested</p></li><li readability=-1><p>You can easily straighten fine strands with one pass</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you have fine hair, we found that the L'ange Hair Le Duo 360° Airflow Styler works best for this hair type.

The clamp style is also a bit awkward at first, but you get used to it with some practice. Coming in under $100, this styler was one of the less expensive tools we tested, making this an excellent value for those with fine hair who need a straightener that won't burn your hair to a crisp.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature Settings: </strong>5 | <strong>Width: </strong>1 inch | <strong>Material:</strong> Titanium</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-with-steamer-loreal-professionnel-steampod-flat-iron--styler></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best with Steamer</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>L'Oreal Professionnel Steampod Flat Iron & Styler</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="L'Oreal Professionnel Steampod Flat Iron &amp;amp; Styler" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/yhLwAMcSXCoV4Mv868SoGxXftJ8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/loreal-professionnel-steampod-flat-iron-styler-5d941103a42d4d528706cfdac430366d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Sephora</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Features steam technology that makes it easier to straighten strands</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Includes a built-in comb for easy styling and helping reduce frizz</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Provides hair with a slick and straight style</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>A little bulkier compared to others we tested</p></li><li readability=0><p>Doesn't curl or style beyond straightening, like some others we tested</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Flat irons aren’t just used for straightening hair; however, if you want one that gives you that amazing slick and straight look, we recommend the L’Oreal Professional Steampod Flat Iron & Styler. This salon-worthy hot tool features a wide design that, albeit a little bulky, works really well at straightening strands without any kinks or flipped ends.

The smart straightener also has plenty of slip, making it easy to achieve a beautiful loose and effortless curl.

For the best drugstore flat iron, we recommend the Kristin Ess 3-in-1 Titanium Flatiron, which is designed for straightening, waving, and curling and does an excellent job at achieving each style — and can be found at your local CVS or Target. During our test trial, we were most impressed by how quickly it warms up and how well it clamps onto strands without tugging and pulling, making for an effective style in just one pass.

We love this straightener because it not only features a design that doesn’t overwhelm beginners, but it also has a 30-minute auto shut-off, which is quicker than a lot of other options and helps ensure safety in case you leave it on by mistake. From a styling perspective, we found that this straightener was not only easy to maneuver due to its lightweight design, but it also glides easily through hair for a quick style.&nbsp;While we think it's a bit pricey for some beginners, it is one of the cheaper ones relative to those on this list, meaning it's a high-quality tool that's designed to last.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-76 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Temperature Settings: </strong>Up to 450 degrees | <strong>Width: </strong>1 inch | <strong>Material:</strong> Ceramic tourmaline</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-42 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="ion Magnesium Flat Iron on white bathroom counter" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/e2vu67edlZ4-alumtHmfYTAzpJA=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-product-ion-magnesium-flat-iron-1-25in-tstaples-153-b13ce0ab635a49c6b2e44306741f2b5d.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="ion Magnesium Flat Iron" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/XKp4muJlLPXLcJZOIUqgpb4Hrwg=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-flat-irons-test-ion-magnesium-1in-tstaples-382-1-af46b5038337469c82dfbb3ccb5a306a.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Tamara Staples</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-fhi-heat-platform-tourmaline-ceramic-professional-styling-flat-iron></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Lightweight</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>FHI Heat Platform Tourmaline Flat Iron</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon FHI HEAT Platform Tourmaline Ceramic Professional Styling Flat Iron" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ALCGYkcHeKLl9cOT2Gd_08iUQiQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/fhi-heat-platform-tourmaline-ceramic-professional-styling-flat-iron-6c7deb4388154a4592bd31807ccee2d9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Glide Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.6</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3.4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Straightening Ability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.1</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Features a slim design that makes it ideal for travel</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Lightweight design makes it easy to maneuver when styling</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Effective at smoothing strands for a more slick look</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-80 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Hot tools can get a little heavy, making it a challenge to not only style but also travel with.

Titanium, on the other hand, is best for thicker hair as it heats up quickly and holds high heat well. “Tourmaline is a crystal that is ground into a fine powder and infused into the plates, which can help reduce frizz by generating negative ions,” Maine adds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Temperature Control&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Temperature control is also important to consider as this ensures you can adjust the heat to your preferences. “Lower heat settings are suitable for fine or damaged hair, while higher settings are needed for thick or coarse hair,” notes Maine. Some hair straighteners (including a majority on our list) have pre-set heat settings while others such as the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">FHI HEAT Platform Tourmaline Ceramic Professional Styling Flat Iron</a> feature a heat range that allows you to select your preferred heat setting.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Plate Size</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s also worth considering the plate size, which can vary depending on the length of your strands and your styling needs. “I typically recommend 1-inch plates as it is plenty of surface to straighten any hair type while being small enough to curl or wave the hair,” says Maine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most straighteners on our list feature a 1-inch plate width, however, if you want something a little wider, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Kristin Ess 3-in-1 Titanium Flatiron</a> and<strong> </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nocaes>BabylissPRO Nano Titanium Dual Ionic Flat Iron</a> are 1.25 inches wide.

Each iron was then tested using different hair types and lengths. We took note of how smooth the glide felt and how many passes it took to get their hair straight. We also utilized a meat thermometer to test the maximum heat and used a stopwatch to time how long each iron took to heat up and shut off automatically. Durability was evaluated by dropping each iron twice at vanity level to see if it would break, chip, or scratch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Throughout the testing period, we reviewed everything from ease-of-use to safety features to heat settings and heat range. We also considered how each hot tool styled hair, including how easy it was to use the straighteners to curl and wave our strands. After the testing period, we compiled our notes and rigorously compared each experience to determine which hot tools are the best of the best. Each flat iron was judged on a 1 to 5 scale (5 being the best) against the following attributes:&nbsp;ease of use, glide performance, straightening ability, and value. The tools that received the highest average scores earned our PEOPLE Tested seal of approval.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faq-7e33f1e4-79a0-4920-8f52-d4221725d8fd></span><p>Frequently Asked Questions</p><ul id=mntl-sc-block-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-faq__content mntl-accordion" readability=50.104815110402><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.89399293286219><p><span class=accordion__title>What kind of flat iron is best?</span></p><p>After testing several flat irons, we found that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>BabylissPRO Nano Titanium Dual Ionic Flat Iron</a> is the best straightener overall, because it features ion technology that allows you to customize your heat styling, has a lightweight design that is easy to maneuver, and has heat settings designed for different hair types so you can easily choose the best temperature for you.

Heat protectants can also provide nourishment and hydration which can help combat some of the negative effects of heat styling, in general.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.98260869565217><p><span class=accordion__title>Is there a difference between cheap and expensive flat irons?</span></p><p>When it comes to more affordable versus expensive flat irons, Kevin Kelly, a celebrity hairstylist and extension expert who has worked with Nicky Hilton, Brittany Cartwright, and more, says it’s all about the quality, as some more expensive options tend to be better made with impressive features. “It’s all about the technology that’s built inside the iron,” Kelly explains. More expensive hot tools also feature more durable materials, better temperature-control settings, and features like ionic or infrared heat which are gentler on the hair, says Maine. With that being said, Maine notes that price isn’t the only indicator of quality and there are more affordable models (such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">TYMO Ring Plus</a>) that also perform well.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.97859690844233><p><span class=accordion__title>Do flat irons harm your hair?</span></p><p>Flat irons can damage your hair if not used carefully. The surface or cuticle of the hair shaft becomes damaged at temperatures above 300 degrees. While there are ways to minimize the potential damage such as using thermal protectors and sticking to one pass per section, some risk is associated with using any high-heat styling tool, especially on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>clip-in extensions</a> that don't have the ability to revitalize themselves.</p><p>According to Stenson, it’s important to use a heat-protectant cream or spray when using any hot tool. “Another damage-reducing practice is to work in small sections so that the heat can penetrate evenly throughout,” Stenson advises. “Last, also keep your flat iron moving as you straighten the hair and avoid allowing the iron to sit in the hair for any prolonged period of time.”</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.96402877697842><p><span class=accordion__title>What is the difference between flat irons and straighteners?</span></p><p>Both of these are tools to straighten the hair.
