I can also confirm she is not in New York," Shawn said at the time.</p><p>Wendy <a href=#>bowed out of her scheduled speaking engagement</a> on May 20th at the Atlanta Women's Expo days before the event due to her apparent declining health.</p><h2>KEVIN'S CONCERN</h2><p>Kevin expressed his concern about the people around Wendy presently who continue <a href=#>to profit off of her</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"What's been made more important by the people around her is that while her health may not be great, she <a href=#>needs to keep on earning income</a>, and in my opinion that should not be a priority at all.</p><p>"And whoever has been hired, they are taking advantage of someone who needs to get better."</p><p>Kevin said <a href=#>his mother's health has declined</a> since she was living with him in Florida from late 2021 until the spring of 2022.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/wendy-williams-flash-big-smile-797630446.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/78e02815-4db3-4b1b-b336-c34efb19d5a0.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/93dd98e5-813c-44a1-83e5-734af1bcda11.jpg><p>Under his care, he said he would take her to <a href=#>restaurants that didn't serve alcohol</a> and he had her exercising and eating healthier.&nbsp;</p><h2>WENDY'S ALCOHOLISM&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>"I know the <a href=#>rate that she uses alcohol isn't like a normal person</a>- and we've spoken about it. I've said, 'This is one thing where you don't know how to approach it normally, and that's fine.'</p><p>"And it's gotten to a point where yes, it could have that <a href=#>effect that it might be fatal</a> because it affects her way worse than a normal person, since it stays in her system," Kevin claimed.&nbsp;</p><p>According to her son, who said he was in his mother's doctor's appointments when she was with him in Florida, Wendy's various ailments have a compounding effect, and her body doesn't process alcohol like the average person.</p><p>"There are a lot of people who <a href=#>are very aware that there is an issue with her drinking</a>, and how that issue may be helped, but I think these people are taking advantage of it while allowing it to play out to make it look like they aren't causing the issue."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/worries-wendy-wendy-williams-sparks-748265696.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/shot-us-sun-wendy-williams-752418468.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/shot-us-sun-exclusive-pics-819725770.jpg><h2>'TAKING ADVANTAGE'</h2><p>Wendy spent <a href=#>nearly three months in a Malibu</a> rehab from August to October of 2022 for her alcoholism, and Kevin said he was told his mother signed contracts either during or immediately after her stay for working arrangements with her jeweler and manager, Will.&nbsp;</p><p>"They had her in a position where <a href=#>she was agreeing to a lot that she shouldn't have</a>. When I heard that, that turned me off," Kevin said.</p><p>"In trying to attempt to know what everyone's intention is around her, at first, I was like, okay this is the team she wants to have around.</p><p>"But once I heard that she was agreeing to stuff around her rehab, I thought, 'Well okay, they are taking advantage.'"</p><p>Kevin claimed that the times that his mother does go to get the help she desperately needs, people seem to swoop in and use the opportunity to get her alone.</p><p>"I feel that when it comes to people wanting to 'help' her, a lot of it is coming from a stance of, okay, she's alone now.</p><p>"Let's try to see how we can make her act the way we want her to act, or if we can kind of control the rate at which she's handling herself."</p><p>Kevin said he also believes his <a href=#>mother's team has emboldened her drinking</a>.</p><p>"If they aren't providing it, they are definitely enabling a type of personality and giving her the <a href=#>green light to drink</a>."</p><p>After Wendy was spotted bar hopping in April, her publicist Shawn <a href=#>released a statement calling her night out a "celebration."</a>&nbsp;</p><p>"They're just putting their hands up. When someone's hired help, it's very easy to just allow certain things to play out," he said of the statement.&nbsp;</p><p>"As much as someone may try to say that they're there for somebody if you're being hired to be there, there is only so much you could say [to that person].</p><p>"I never want to shame anybody, but in terms of asking if that person is there so that my mom can be the healthiest person and have a long career, stuff like that, they aren't in it for that.</p><p>"They are just there for the here and now," he added.</p><p>"I don't want any of this to come across that I am mad at anyone.</p><p>"They don't know the situation fully and there are times when she does talk that she may <a href=#>sound coherent enough</a>, and they may think: 'Okay, she just wants to have fun.'</p><p>"And for that reason, I will never have hate, even with the hired help, everyone is just trying to take care of themselves. It is what it is," he continued.</p><h2>WENDY'S UNSCRIPTED PROJECT</h2><p>At the end of 2022, Kevin claimed Will asked him if he wanted to be part of the <a href=#>unscripted project Wendy has been spotted filming</a> in recent months.</p><p>"The jeweler reached out to me last year and he basically said, 'We are planning on this [project] being a way that would tell the public about what's happening,' and I was opposed to it.</p><p>"I felt like, and I still feel like, she shouldn't be doing anything that involves putting herself in front of the camera.</p><p>"It goes back to putting working first, and herself second.</p><p>"I was then reapproached by the production, not by Will directly, a second time, and I just said 'No.'"</p><p>The 22-year-old college student had always been supported financially by his mother and had in large part <a href=#>lost that support when her financial affairs were taken over by guardian</a> Sabrina Morrissey in May of 2022.</p><p>Turning down Will's offer to be part of the unscripted project about his mother meant he was saying no to a lucrative opportunity that could have been a financial life raft for him, he explained.&nbsp;</p><p>"They tried to offer me $25,000 to appear [in the unscripted project] with Executive Producer credit.</p><p>"And I chose to not do it for the simple fact that I just felt like however this came about was under a contract she shouldn't have agreed to, for <a href=#>a project that wouldn't paint her in a good light</a>."</p><p>When asked for comment on the various allegations against him Will Selby said: "No comment because half of this stuff isn’t even true, majority of this is false."</p><p>When asked for further clarification, Will insisted he saw Kevin and spoke to him in April in Miami.</p><p>Will claimed: "I was in Miami with Kevin. I forced him to have a conversation because he seemed a little disgruntled. I spoke to him face to face, 1000%. I was like, 'If there's a problem, let's talk. If there's an issue, let's have a conversation.'"</p><p>When pushed in yet another request for comment to expand on any additional points, Will responded: "There is so much here that is inaccurate it’s really not worth me commenting."</p><p>The U.S. Sun reached out to Wendy's publicist Shawn Zanotti multiple times, and she declined to comment.</p><h2>WENDY'S GUARDIANSHIP</h2><p>Kevin also takes issue with <a href=#>Wendy's guardian, Sabrina Morrissey</a>.</p><p>Wendy was placed in guardianship after Wells Fargo froze her bank accounts as they suspected the star was the victim of "financial <a href=#>exploitation, dementia, or undue influence," according to court papers</a> first revealed by The U.S. Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's been really sad what's been allowed to happen, and ever since the court hearings ended, something just has to be brought to light about what's going on and how much people are taking in this situation.</p><p>"In terms of who is there now, people have put other things in front of her actually healing and getting better, and unfortunately, unlike many other alcoholics, <a href=#>she is worth a lot more money</a>."</p><p>Wendy's son continued: "I know that Sabrina has a relationship with the jeweler, and I would assume though that they are cool with each other. This is how this was created.</p><p>"And it seems like it's more about making sure he is okay.</p><p>"I don't know what the ultimate goal is for [Sabrina] as the person in charge of stuff, but there have never been articles put out saying [Wendy] isn't okay."</p><p>Wendy's son hit out at the guardian's handling of Wendy, and her lack of communication with the star's family.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't feel like Sabrina has done a great job at all.</p><p>"I think that based on her actions, I'd have to assume something is going on that she's not telling me.</p><p>"Whether it be that she is receiving income on the side or what, but there is a lot of her pushing away of myself and everybody down here, and saying that she's not going give updates. She's really vague with updates."</p><p>Sabrina Morrissey did not respond to The U.S. Sun's request for comment.</p><h2>A SON'S HOPE</h2><p>Ultimately, Kevin insists that his mother absolutely should not have been working, she should not continue to work and she <a href=#>should be focusing on her health and her recovery</a>.</p><p>Kevin said: "I think that it's best for her to have to prioritize her health first.</p><p>"Nobody around her will tell her this, but she doesn't have to be working.</p><p>"She needs to take a break from trying to progress her career and just be proud of what she's accomplished."</p><p>When asked if he had a plan in all of this, Wendy's son said: "The plan is that I am hoping and praying that the people who are up there [in New York] with her right now don't lead her down the path to where something can't happen to help her.&nbsp;</p><p>"If there was a way or if there was a plan I could think of I wouldn't be here doing this interview. I would be doing something that I could do."<br>Kevin added that he thinks something has gone seriously wrong with the way things have been set up for Wendy.</p><p>"In terms of what is and what isn't; <a href=#>when she was with me, none of these articles of her not looking well ever came out</a>. When she got dragged back up there [to New York City] after the court hearings, that started happening, and from that perspective, something has gone wrong."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Kevin said he is holding onto hope.</p><p>"I'm praying that whoever is in control now doesn't ruin whatever hope there is for her to get back up again."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/ailing-wendy-williams-permanent-financial-781512563.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/wendy-williams-son-kevin-jr-821445634-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/wendy-williams-son-kevin-jr-704433484-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/06/wendy-williams-lawyer-vows-return-713884862.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYmuBc3ySaK6eppSueri1y6WgmqWjYsCwuoyknK%2BhnmKzqr7SrWSipqSav7e1xLBkp52Rp3qlscCtn2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
