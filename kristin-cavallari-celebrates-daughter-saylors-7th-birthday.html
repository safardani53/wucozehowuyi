The Laguna Beach alum added: “You take care of everyone and have the biggest heart. My favorite gift is being your mama. I love you Saylor James."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

My favorite gift is being your mama. I love you Saylor James.”</p><p>The Uncommon James founder <a href=#>shared a rare photo of her and Saylor</a> walking hand-in-hand in what appeared to be their yard in Tennessee. Cavallari wore a velvet jacket and calf-high boots while her mini-me donned a white ballerina leotard, skirt and matching leggings.</p><p>The former Hills star shares Saylor and <a href=#>sons Camden, 10, and Jaxon, 8</a>, with ex-husband <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong></a>. Cavallari announced <a href=#>her split from the one-time Chicago Bears quarterback</a>, 39, in April 2020 <a href=#>after nearly seven years</a> of marriage.</p><p>Cutler hinted in June that he and the <a href=#>Very Cavallari</a> alum had <a href=#>reached a divorce settlement</a>, but a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time that the <a href=#>proceedings are not yet finalized</a>.</p><p>Despite the delay in their divorce, <a href=#>the True Comfort author</a> exclusively told Us in June that “everything is going well” when it comes to her and Cutler’s <a href=#>coparenting relationship</a>.</p><p>“My life feels very full,” <a href=#>Cavallari said, noting that she thinks she’s “done” having children</a>. “I don’t know what will happen in the future, but I’m not out there looking to have more kids. It’d be one thing if I met someone and they didn’t have kids or something, but <a href=#>I feel very happy with my three</a>.”</p><p>The Balancing in High Heels author, however, has kept her dating life somewhat private since <a href=#>her brief romance</a> with <a href=#><strong>Jeff Dye</strong></a> in fall 2020 following her and Cutler’s breakup.</p><p>“I prefer someone to not be [famous]. I really, in my head, my ideal man is a businessman who no one knows,” she explained during a July episode of <a href=#>the “Not Skinny, But Not Fat” podcast</a>. “I don’t like people that often. I have gone on a date with a businessman in Nashville. I’m pretty picky, I guess. But I’m not going to settle, I’m going to stay picky.”</p><p>While Cavallari revealed that she’d been “actively dating” since March, she insisted that she had no plans of getting back together with her high school sweetheart, <a href=#><strong>Stephen Colletti</strong></a>.</p><p>“I have so much love for him and I always will. He was my first real love,” the businesswoman told podcast listeners of her friendship with Colletti, 36. “It was such a sweet, sweet love, but no. No, I love him.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Cavallari’s former Laguna Beach costar — and high school BFF — <a href=#>Alex Hooser</a> (Alex H.), who now goes by her married name, <a href=#><strong>Lauren Olsen</strong></a>, <a href=#>exclusively told Us that she thought the exes would’ve been good together</a> when they were both single in 2020. (Colletti is currently dating <a href=#><strong>Alex Weaver</strong></a>.)</p><p>“I’m always rooting for them. They’re both so good-looking,” Olsen, 35, said in November. “It would almost be like when <a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mila Kunis</strong></a> got together. You’d be like, ‘Yes, it’s perfect.’”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYycnKWdkqeutbHSZpuarZedwaa%2BjKyYsqSfp8Bug9OhZJuhoqm1pa3YaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
