Thanks for always being there. Love ya dad." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Chris' love for his parents is not limited to words as soon after he found stardom, the actor made it a point to pay off all of his father's debt in one fell swoop.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Independent&nbsp;</a>in 2015, Liam reportedly became teary when he recalled Chris calling his father and telling him to check his bank balance.</p><p>"[Criag] called my brother Chris back and said, 'I don't know how to feel.
