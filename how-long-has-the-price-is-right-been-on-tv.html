The game show actually made its debut in 1956 with host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bill Cullen</a>. It initially aired on NBC and ran for nine years. In September 1972, the show was revamped for CBS and brought back into our homes with Bob Barker as the host.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>The version we've all come to know (the version that Bob Barker started), has been running on CBS ever since — for an impressive 50 years. For 35 of those years, it was Bob who was asked contestants guess the price of their favorite household products. The icon retired from hosting the show in 2007, and comedian Drew Carey has stood in his place since then.</p><p>In September 2021, CBS celebrated the 50th season of the show with a Price Is Right 50th Anniversary Special, which looked back at the <a href=#>show's biggest winners</a> and featured never-before-seen outtakes and a salute to Bob Barker.</p><p>Ahead of the special, Bob himself congratulated the show's success in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>. "The show has the most enthusiastic and fun audience that one could ever ask for," he said. "They truly were and are the heart and soul of the show. It was an incredibly memorable ride. Congratulations to The Price is Right on 50 historic years. Here's to 50 more!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>Current host Drew Carey has said that the job is a dream. "I never thought my safe space would be on a sound stage, wearing a mic, cameras on me constantly, and with millions of people watching," he told Deadline. "But that's what The Price Is Right is for me. I love it."</p><p>You can watch The Price Is Right weekdays at 11 a.m. EST on CBS. You can also catch special episodes of The Price Is Right at Night featuring celebrities playing for charity as well as deserving civilian contestants.
