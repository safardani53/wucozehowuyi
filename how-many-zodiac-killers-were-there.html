But <a href=#>Peacock‚Äôs</a> two-episode documentary, Myth of the Zodiac Killer, posits that there could be <a href=#>more than one Zodiac Killer</a>. So how many Zodiac Killers were there?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How many Zodiac Killers were there? It‚Äôs possible that there was more than one.</h2><p>The Zodiac Killer first taunted the SFPD in July 1969, just before the infamous Manson murders. In Myth of the Zodiac Killer, investigative journalist Thomas Henry Horan theorizes that there were multiple people behind the Zodiac killings ‚Ä¶ and that they could have been connected to <a href=#>Charles Manson</a>. He says that after the Manson murders, the Zodiac‚Äôs letters and murders became more erratic and newsworthy. After all, the Zodiac wanted attention.</p><p>While the Zodiac couldn‚Äôt be Charles Manson himself (the Zodiac murders continued after Manson was already in prison), it could have been a group of people not unlike the ‚ÄúManson family.‚Äù</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The Myth of the Zodiac Killer director Andrew Nock told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a>, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very unusual for cold cases to have this much information. But if you read all the police files, you see that there‚Äôs very little linking these crimes together. Different weapons, different M.O., different victim profile, even eyewitness statements, different locations -‚Äî or a trophy being taken from one, but none of the others ‚Ä¶‚Äù</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Although he tries to disprove Horan‚Äôs theory in the documentary, the theory holds water because of those factors. Horan believes that multiple killers combined to create the myth of the Zodiac. Media and police then fueled the fire that the Zodiac was one person instead of many because that‚Äôs a more intriguing story. However, the documentary also disproves Horan in multiple ways‚Äîmostly that police already considered many of his theories and ruled them out.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>another day spent not knowing who the zodiac killer is</p>‚Äî üêç ùìôùìÆùì∑üêç (@sparkly_serpent) <a href=#>July 6, 2023</a></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Still, the most likely theory is that just one Zodiac killer is responsible for the deaths attributed to him and that he‚Äôs likely dead. However, other copycat Zodiac killers have popped up over the years.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">There are a few other Zodiac Killers who have popped up over the years.</h2><p>The most well-known copycat Zodiac Killer was the <a href=#>New York Zodiac Killer</a>. Heriberto ‚ÄúEddie‚Äù Seda was active in New York City from 1990 to 1993 before he was caught in 1996. He killed three people and injured six others, and like the Zodiac Killer, he sent menacing coded messages to the NYPD. The difference, of course, is that Seda was caught. His story was also told in Netflix‚Äôs <a href=#>Catching Killers</a>.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Additionally, a juvenile killer known only as Boy A to protect his identity in Kobe, Japan, was also called a Zodiac killer. He beheaded special-ed pupil Jun Hase with a chainsaw, left his body in front of the school for students to see, and put a note in Hase‚Äôs mouth. Police commented that the murder and the note were reminiscent of the Zodiac. He also confessed to murdering 10-year-old Ayaka Yamashita.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Finally, a South Korean serial killer, Lee Choon-Jae, was often compared to the Zodiac Killer. He operated from 1986 to 1994 and took the lives of at least 15 women and girls in Hwaseong. These were known as the Hwaseong murders. In 2003, <a href=#>Bong Joon-ho</a> (who directed the Oscar-winning film, Parasite) told the story in Memories of a Murder.</p><p>Because the South Korean Killer and the Zodiac Killer were both prolific and elusive, their cases and stories were often compared in the media and film. But that was the only tie between the two. When Choon-Jae was later caught in 2018, he could no longer be compared to the one and only Zodiac.</p><p>So there are at least three other killers who have been compared to the Zodiac Killer, and while experts agree that the original Zodiac Killer is likely just one man ‚Ä¶ anything is possible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJlqqSxqq3CZqKipJyav7R51p6pnmWknbKzsQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
