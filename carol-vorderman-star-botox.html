The 58-year-old telly host wowed fans when she wore a sizzling red dress at the ­Britain’s Got Talent finals.
But the mum of two’s sexy look is a far cry from the prim young maths whizz who first appeared on Channel 4’s words and numbers contest in 1984.
And over the years, Carol has given mixed messages when asked if she has had surgical help to tweak her appearance."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There is also a change between 2013-2015</li><li><strong>Botox, £1,500 a year: </strong>There is no doubt Carol has had Botox – you can see from the shape of her eyebrows after 2002. But she has had too much — after 2015 it distorts her face.</li><li><strong>Boob jobs, £4,000: </strong>Carol now appears to have a 32D bust. It could be natural but from 1994-2002 she appears to have had some enhancement.</li><li><strong>Upper lip botox, £500: </strong>This prevents a gummy smile. In early pictures Carol showed her teeth when she smiled but after that she did not. There are signs of lip filler, too.</li><li><strong>Masseter botox, £300: </strong>This gives the face a more oval shape. Carol may have had it in the past decade.</li><li><strong>Bum implants, £3,000: </strong>Buttock implants give a fuller shape but I’m not sure she has had these. She could be wearing padded pants.</li><li><strong>Tummy tuck, £2,000 to £4,000: </strong>In the picture of Carol at BGT, her waist is remarkably thin.</li><li><strong>Teeth whitening, £500: </strong>From around 2016 her teeth are whiter.</li><li><strong>Laser resurfacing, £1,000: </strong>This reduces wrinkles and fills in lines. Likely done in the past five years, given her smooth complexion.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000477349405-e1560629014441.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000280888707-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000477271223.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000000078994-e1560635830979.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000284066743-1.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">'Hard graft in gym gets results'</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>By Tracey Lea Sayer, Fashion director of Fabulous</p><p>IF I look half as good as Carol when I’m 58, I’ll be one happy lady. She has totally transformed her style over the years – but then, who do you know who hasn’t changed their look in the past 30 years?</p><p>We no longer wear power suits with piano ties, and shaggy perms are banished to Room 101. We have also learnt a lot about healthy eating, beauty treatments and the importance of exercise.</p><p>Carol has always been curvy, but she is now toned and sculpted from all the hard graft at the gym. And boy has that work paid off. She looks simply sensational in this image.</p><p>She has great upper arms, a toned, flat stomach, good calf muscles – and that famous rear. We’ve all seen Carol grow up on our screens, and she has matured into a gorgeous, successful and happy older woman. We should all give her a big high-five for that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/NINTCHDBPICT000284068585.jpg> <span class=article__bc_video-caption>Britain's Got Talent stars 4MG leave Carol Vorderman screaming in shock as they perform magic trick on her on Lorraine</span><br><p><strong>Got a story?</strong>&nbsp;email&nbsp;<a href=#>digishowbiz@the-sun.co.uk</a> or call us direct on 02077824220.&nbsp;<strong>We pay for videos too</strong>.
