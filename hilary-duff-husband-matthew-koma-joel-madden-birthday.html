He was sitting on what appeared to be a bed, while <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Nicole</a> struck a pose while sitting on the floor next to him. “Also, now feels like a good time to tell you about me and your wife,” he joked.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Joel clearly got a kick out of the posts and reshared some of them to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story, with a sweet message and photo of himself and Nicole: “We love you Matt,” he wrote, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>It’s clear that Joel and Hilary have remained on good terms. The pair dated from July 2004, until November 2006, when the actress was still starring on the beloved Disney sitcom&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire. In the years after the split, it’s been clear that the Good Charlotte rocker and his wife have become close friends with Hilary and Matthew. The two couples were even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted on a group date</a> along with Pulse Music Group founder&nbsp;<strong>Josh Abraham&nbsp;</strong>and his wife, as well as Fall Out Boy bassist&nbsp;<strong>Pete Wentz&nbsp;</strong>and his partner&nbsp;<strong>Meagan Camper,&nbsp;</strong>in February 2022.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5BsZqGhnJa%2FunnDrp2fZZiqwKOtzZ1kppmkqbWmw4ykpqaZXZ%2B8priMppidnJWjeqO10a2fnZmpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
