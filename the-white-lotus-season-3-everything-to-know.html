Fortunately, series creator <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Mike White</a> confirmed that a third installment of the vacation-based hit is on the horizon.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[Mike's] courage to explore the uncharted waters of the human psyche, paired with his signature irreverent humor and buoyant directing style, have us all <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>dreaming of more vacation days at the resort</a> we've come to adore," executive vice president of HBO Programming Francesca Orsi said in a statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">News that The White Lotus had been renewed for a season 3 came just three episodes after season 2 premiered, causing fans to speculate possible plot points and potential characters to make their return.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Each season of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>award-winning anthology series</a> — which recently took home two SAG Awards — has seen a (mostly) new crop of guests check into an entirely different White Lotus resort. While the first season was set in Hawaii and the second was set in Sicily, the third season is heading to Southeast Asia.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's everything to know about The White Lotus season 3, including who's in the cast and when filming is scheduled to begin.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-who-is-starring-in-the-white-lotus-season-3></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Who is starring in The White Lotus season 3?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Fabio Lovino/HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Since the HBO hit is an anthology series, the cast and plot differ from season to season. In April 2023, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Variety reported</a> that Natasha Rothwell, who played spa manager Belinda Lindsey, will return for season 3.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">On Jan. 5, HBO announced new cast members to star in the third installment. Among them include Leslie Bibb, Dom Hetrakul, Jason Isaacs, Michelle Monaghan, Parker Posey and Tayme Thapthimthong.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Prior to viewing the last episode of season 2, fans could assume <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Jennifer Coolidge</a> would be reprising her role as Tanya McQuoid-Hunt come round three (since she and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Jon Gries</a> were the only actors to reprise their roles in the show's sophomore season) — but following her fate in the finale, the only possible chance for the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Emmy-winning actress</a> to make her return would be via flashbacks.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meanwhile, White teased the potential future of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Michael Imperioli</a>'s character, Dominic Di Grosso, when speaking with Esquire post the season 2 wrap. "Who knows, maybe there'll be another White Lotus season where <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Dominic comes with his wife</a> and they patch it all up!" White said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't want to think about it too much," he continued. "Because the idea of that makes me so happy. I don't want to be disappointed… I would want nothing more than that. I just loved working with Mike [Imperioli] so much."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Haley Lu Richardson in White Lotus.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clearly, White is keen on having Dominic return to the scene, but he also <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>hinted at a possible continuation</a> of Gries' Greg Hunt and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Haley Lu Richardson</a>'s Portia since season 2's final scenes left a lot of questions unanswered.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think as far as like, what happens to Greg and the conspiracy of Tanya's death, it's possible that I think Portia is scared enough to just leave it alone," White told Esquire. "But maybe you'll have to wait to find out what happens."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As for season 1 characters making a potential comeback, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Connie Britton</a> (who played the powerful CEO Nicole Mossbacher) told Deadline in June <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>why she didn't reprise her role in season 2</a> — but gave fans hope for a possible revival when the show makes its return.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[White] wanted me to be in the second season, and there was an idea that I loved for the character," said Britton. "A piece of casting didn't work in the second season and we're hoping to [do] that in the third season. I would love to see a spin-off on every character in that show."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-is-the-white-lotus-season-3-about></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What is The White Lotus season 3 about?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy of HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As previously mentioned, The White Lotus is an anthology series, so each season doesn't necessarily pick up from where it last left off. But with White's aforementioned tease that he'd be interested in the mystery surrounding Greg and the conspiracy of Tanya's death, a possible continuation isn't out of the picture.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Will Greg get his money? Who was he talking to on the phone? Will Portia put the pieces of the puzzle together and muster up the courage to confront him? These are the season 2 questions fans need answered following the murderous boat scene — and quite frankly, so does White. "It feels like there's gotta be somebody who's gonna track it back down to Greg," he told Esquire.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While those plot points are merely potential, White did indirectly confirm that The White Lotus <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>season 3 storyline could be set in Asia</a> when speaking about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>each season's respective themes</a> during an HBO Max featurette after the final episode aired.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The first season we highlighted money and then the second season is sex and I think the third season, it would be maybe a kind of satirical and funny look at death in Eastern religion and spirituality — it feels like it could be a rich tapestry to do another round at White Lotus," he said.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-where-will-the-white-lotus-season-3-be-set></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Where will The White Lotus season 3 be set?</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Fabio Lovino/HBO</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After White previously teased that he'd like the show to "<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>go to a whole different continent</a>," Variety reported in March 2023 that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>production is heading to Thailand for the new season</a>. At the time, the publication added that it's possible the new season will be set at one of the Four Seasons' "four properties in Thailand, which are located in Bangkok, Chiang Mai, Koh Samui and the Golden Triangle."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-when-will-production-begin-for-the-white-lotus-season-3></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>When will production begin for The White Lotus season 3?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The White Lotus season 3 will begin production in February around Koh Samui, Phuket and Bangkok as the plot follows a new group of guests at another White Lotus property. HBO has partnered with the Tourism Authority of Thailand to support the filming and promotion of the third installment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“We are honored to have Amazing Thailand featured as the filming location for the highly anticipated upcoming season of The White Lotus," Thapanee Kiatphaibool, the governor of the tourism authority of Thailand Thapanee Kiatphaibool, said in a statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Thailand has long been considered one of the world’s favorite filming locations," she continued.
