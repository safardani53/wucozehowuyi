Hair removal after your spray may remove some of your tan.</li><li>Exfoliate before your session to ensure a smooth base.</li><li>If you want a perfectly bronzed face, remove any makeup first.</li><li>Remove any jewellery to avoid lines.</li><li>Apply nail polish - this will help prevent the tan staining your nails and cuticles.</li><li>Don't wear perfume before your appointment.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/nintchdbpict000384625858.jpg><h2>How long does it last?</h2><p>A spray tan is not permanent or semi-permanent.</p><p>And it doesn’t offer any protection from the sun’s UV rays, so you’ll still need sunscreen if your soaking up some warmth.</p><p>Depending on the brand and how it was applied, a spray tan usually lasts around a week.</p><p>There are LOADS of products out there that help your tan last a little longer, such as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sienna X's Radience Body Balm, which is only £5.95.</a></p><p>You should remember to keep your skin moisturised and hydrated, and this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sleep Mask Tan Body from James Read</a> does just that overnight and also gradually tans, so you'll stay bronzed forever.</p><p>If the tan is long gone and faded and you need a quick fix to get you back to the ultimate bronzed goddess status, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Freshly Baked London's Watermelon Mousse in Dark</a> will do just that for only £9.29.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000413044062.jpg><h2>What should you wear after a spray tan?</h2><p>After you've been sprayed, you should wait until the formula has completely dried before getting dressed.</p><p>That being said, you should still make sure you bring dark, loose fitting clothing with you to put on afterwards - this will help stop unsightly marks and any stains on lighter coloured garments.</p><p>When it comes to taking a shower or having a bath after your tanning session, it will depend on the brand of tan/formula that the beauty therapist has applied - but they should tell you how long to wait.</p><p>As a general rule, most tans develop over six to eight hours - so it is usually best to leave your tan overnight (just make sure to protect those bed sheets!) and shower the following morning.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MOST READ IN FABULOUS</h2></p><h2>Our 'Dying For A Tan' campaign</h2><p>Instead of using spray tan, around one in ten young Brits, including children as young as eight, visit one of the UK's <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">7,000 tanning salons</a> to use sunbeds.</p><p>But using sunbeds before you’re 35 increases your chance of developing melanoma - the deadliest form of skin cancer - by a horrific 87 per cent.</p><p>That's why the Sun's Fabulous has launched the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dying For A Tan campaign</a> to raise awareness of the dangers associated with the use of sunbeds.</p><p>Sunbeds pelt skin with ultraviolet (UV) rays, which are often stronger than the midday Mediterranean sun - 20 minutes on a sunbed is equivalent to four hours in the sun.</p><p>The UV radiation causes melanin to be released in the body, which gives skin a tan, but also causes skin cancer.</p><p>Cancer Research has revealed that rates of melanoma have soared by 45 per cent since 2004, with skin cancer now the fifth most common cancer in the UK.</p><p>Every year, 2,500 Britons die from the disease and 100,000 people are diagnosed with it.</p><p>During the campaign, we'll be telling stories of women who have lost an eye to cancer, had huge holes gauged out of their skin, and been left looking decades older than their age - all because of sunbeds.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Kim Kardashian shows off her golden skin in naked Snapchat video</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5RubHJtYWl8tLzRmrBmrJGjeqm71maroqijYrWwucRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
