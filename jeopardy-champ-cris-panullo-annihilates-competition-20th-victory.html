More than double in just like 15 months!"</p><p>A third fan commented: "Well a classic runaway from Cris to win Game no. 20. Simple as that. And got the FJ right thanks to the classical music part of the clue."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><p>Cris played his 19th game on Thursday and the difficult questions weren't all he had to look out for during the game.</p><p>The star also faced some <a href=#>shady comments from another contestant</a>.</p><p>Rob Lamanna, a new player, celebrated audibly when Cris missed a question during the show, missing the chance to take an even bigger lead by snagging a Daily Double.</p><p>Of Cris' many wins, <a href=#>15 have been runaways</a>, meaning there was no chance other players could catch up to him by the time they reached Final Jeopardy.</p><p>Thursday's game, however, was much closer and Cris struggled in some areas, including a Daily Double he stumbled upon during gameplay.</p><p>During the second round, Cris led with $23K while Rob was still in the game with $14K, Jeri with $1.8K</p><p>Jeri landed on the last randomly placed "Daily Double" left - meaning Cris couldn't take the W by default getting it correct and betting big.</p><p>Before Jeri answered it, Rob turned to her and said "thank you, Jeri."</p><p>Host&nbsp;<a href=#>Ken Jennings</a>, 48, heard him and joked: “You kept Cris from finding it!"</p><p>Rob nodded sarcastically up and down toward Ken, hinting that was why he was so happy.</p><p>Cris made an upset face but didn't say a word.</p><h2>CRIS CLINCHES VICTORY</h2><p>Going into Final Jeopardy, <a href=#>Cris finished up with $27,600</a> to Rob's $14,200 and Jeri's $3,900.</p><p>Cris got the Shakespearian clue correct and closed the curtains on his competitors with $28,821, just $2K more than Rob who went for broke with a huge last wager.</p><p><a href=#>Cris</a> now has a 19-day total of $666,744 - only four contestants have ever amassed more.</p><p>Eagle-eyed Jeopardy! fans were thrilled he won but left bothered by how Rob handled the mid-game moment.&nbsp;</p><p>One Reddit user wrote: "Rob's smirk and 'Thank you Jeri' when she chose the third Daily Double felt a bit off-putting."</p><p>Another wrote: "I agree, but if you look at it charitably, maybe he was thanking Jeri for keeping Cris from getting it? Still, it seemed to be an unnecessary comment to me."</p><p>A third wrote: "Oh I absolutely think that's what he meant; that's part of what irked me haha."</p><p>A fourth defended: "I think he was just playing really hard in a very unenviable position."</p><p>A fifth fan wrote that even if the reasoning behind the gesture was understandable, it was not in good taste to say something.</p><p>"Yeah, not a big fan of that too especially since Cris seems like a nice dude, and it borders on bad sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p><p>"But, I'm going to give Rob the benefit of the doubt and just chalk it up to his competitive nature.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Every contestant dreams of being the champion and some aren't there to make friends.
