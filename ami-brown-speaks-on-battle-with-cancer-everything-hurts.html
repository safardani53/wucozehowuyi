She is currently in a hospital bed in Southern California, where she was transported this summer in order to receive the best care possible."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Everything hurts," <a href=#>Brown tells the publication</a>.</p><p>The long-time reality star’s throat is raw from the radiation, and she’s dropped from 128 pounds to 89.4 pounds.</p><p>Based on the aggressiveness of the cancer, her husband and Alaskan Bush People patriarch Billy says the situation is not good.</p><p>Billy Brown says doctors &nbsp;told the family that survival statistics for someone in Brown’s situation are as low as three percent.</p><p>But Ami remains as optimistic as one can be given her circumstances.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/ami.jpg><p>“I realized early into this that it’s very easy to want to give up and just die. And on the pessimist side, it could be my last days,” she says.</p><p>“But I have the will to fight.”</p><p>Ami’s health struggles have been at the center of Alaskan Bush People Season 7, which wraps up this week on the Discovery Channel.</p><p>It sounds as if an eighth season is on tap, but the <a href=#>Browns will not be residing in Browntown</a> if/when it airs.</p><p>In this exclusive Q&A with People, Brown says she first felt pain in her back last fall. She thought it was just arthritis… until a scan was taken in December.</p><p>As you can tell by some of her quotes here, Ami is handling the diagnosis in courageous fashion. Her kids, however?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"They have to strengthen their wings a little," she says to People, adding:</p><p>"There are good days and bad days – for them and for me."</p><p>"But they handle their emotions pretty good. There are days that they have to talk about it and then talk about it again.</p><p>"I have faith that they will remain strong."</p><p>Brown says she wanted to do the People interview in order to help others with cancer.</p><p>"I was nervous as a cat the first time I went in for radiation. I hope if people watch the show and see what I’m going through and it will take away a lot of their fear."</p><p>What an admirable reason for speaking out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/amy-brown.png><p>Does she ever think about dying? Does she ever concern herself with what happens next?</p><p>How can she not, right? On occasion, at least, right?</p><p>This is what Ami says about the prospect of passing away:</p><p>Worrying about it only makes it worse. There is hope and that hope is having faith in God. You can’t give up. I tell people be happy. Just be happy. It’s a choice.</p><p>Things can be hard and you just want to curl up but you have to shine.</p><p>We continue to send our thoughts and prayers to Ami Brown and her family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/alaskan-bush-people-pic.jpg><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WFcK3MomSbqp%2Bsu26%2Fz56YpKtdpLtursCtq6WdXay2tbSMnJinm5WneqbCxKuwraCZo7RutNSrq6xn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
