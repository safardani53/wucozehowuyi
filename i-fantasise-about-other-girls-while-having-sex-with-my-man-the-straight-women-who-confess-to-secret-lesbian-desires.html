Did it mean I was a lesbian trying to be straight?</p><p>I kept my fantasies to myself and decided to secretly enjoy my lust for the female form.</p><p>Over the next few years my brushes with female lust increased.</p><p>I’d see a sexy woman in an advert and wonder what it would be like to have sex with her.</p><p>I’ve kissed a woman when I was single and I told Freddy about it when we met, but nothing else happened.</p><p>He knows that I’m a passionate person and understands how girls kissing is more of a mutual affection thing rather than changing sexuality.</p><p>Whilst girls are gentle and tender guys are more rough and dominant.

I didn’t want to date women, and I certainly couldn’t imagine having a long-term relationship with one. But I did want to have sex with them</p><p>I had kissed female friends at parties – mostly for show, and never felt anything for them, so I thought I was straight.</p><p>But if I was straight, why did I find the idea of having sex with a fictional woman so appealing?</p><p>To start with my fantasies were confined to hypothetical women.</p><p>When I masturbated I would imagine having a threesome with a man and a woman.&nbsp;Then I progressed to reading lesbian erotica, or watching lesbian porn.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Real Life</h2></p><p>During my fantasies I was drawn to women, but after I orgasmed my interest in same sex relationships would completely disappear.</p><p>On my gap year I moved to London and started spending time with more sexually fluid people.</p><p>I realised that sexuality isn’t as black and white as being straight or gay, and started to wonder if I was bisexual.</p><p>I had a handful of sexual encounters with women, which for the most part were good fun but didn’t satisfy me in the same way that sex with men did.</p><p>I want to have sex with women, but when it came down to it in real life, I would rather be intimate with a man.</p><span class=quote-credit>Rebecca Reid</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>28</span><p>I would fancy the woman in question hugely until we actually became intimate, at which point something usually felt just a little bit off.</p><p>I started to identify as bisexual, because that was what everyone else seemed to think I was.</p><p>Surely if you have sex with men and women, you must be bi?
