Nearly 20 years after the release of Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story, a sequel is officially in the works. The film doesn’t have an official title yet, but you can rest assured: Peter LaFleur is headed back to the dodgeball court after all these years.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>The 2004 film made over $168 million at the box office and has become a beloved comedy classic of the early aughts. The comedy also introduced sports fans to ESPN 8: The Ocho. Fans have been demanding a Dodgbeall 2 for years now, and they’re finally getting their wish. <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> has rounded up everything we know so far about the Dodgeball sequel, including how other cast members feel about returning and more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dodgeball-2-the-cast-ec-embed1.jpg><h2>Is There Going To Be A Dodgeball 2?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Start your dodgeball training now because Dodgeball 2 is happening. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a> reported that <strong>Vince Vaughn</strong> is expected to star and most likely produce Dodgeball 2. The film will be written by<strong> Jordan VanDina</strong>, and it’s currently in early development at 20th Century Studios.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>A Dodgeball sequel has been talked about for years, but the development of a second film wasn’t substantial until now. Vince revealed that he had an idea for a Dodgeball sequel in 2022, so maybe that’s what got the ball rolling.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“They’ve always talked about these things forever and I had an idea that was fun and the studio likes it, so we’ll see where it goes,” Vince told<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;in December 2022. “I think <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ben [Stiller]</strong></a> is open to doing it, I think he’s in the same boat as me actually which is if it’s a really fun and great idea then that’s fun, but if it’s just something to go do it again then why?”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>He continued, “You would just want to make sure going into&nbsp;Dodgeball that it feels like a nice continuation and a story that could stand on its own. I think for all of us if it feels right and it’s funny, it would be something to go back to, and if it’s not, it’s just another idea getting kicked around.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dodgeball-2-the-cast-ec-embed3.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>A month earlier, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Justin Long</strong></a> admitted that he was totally on board for the sequel, but it was just about convincing Ben to come back. “Of course, I would love to do it and I hope that it ends up happening, but I think Ben [Stiller] is a little…what he told me on that podcast was that he’s a little trepidatious about doing a sequel to something so beloved, something that people enjoy so much that,” Justin told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>ComicBook.com</a>. “It’s very risky, you don’t wanna sh*t on the original, you want something just as good. So I think he’s a little wary of that, of trying to recreate something that was very specific to that time, but I hope he comes around on it.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The Barbarian alum added, “Vince is a very convincing person, so I’m just hoping Vince can convince him with his idea. It’s a funny idea, I don’t wanna say what it is. I know Ben loves Dodgeball and loves that character. I remember how much fun he had playing it. He was always laughing.” Given that a month later Vince said that Ben is “open” to returning, his convincing worked!</p><p id=content-paragraph-10><strong>Rawson Marshall Thurber</strong>, who wrote and directed the original film, spoke about a possible sequel and TV series back in 2021.&nbsp;“You know what — never say never. I never thought about Dodgeball as a series, but that actually might be fun,” he told <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Deadline</a>. “I’m really proud of Dodgeball — it’s my first film and something people still really like it seems. I would say never say never, and it would have to be the right take on it. But yeah, maybe.”</p><h2>Dodgeball 2 Cast</h2><p id=content-paragraph-11><strong>Vince Vaughn</strong> is the only main cast member set to return for the Dodgeball sequel as of right now. Since the film is in early development, additional casting has not been announced. In his December 2022 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Vince hinted that <strong>Ben Stiller</strong> is “open” to returning as White Goodman, Pete’s dodgeball archnemesis.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dodgeball-2-the-cast-ec-embed4.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-12>The first film had a treasure trove of comedy talent that could return for the film, including <strong>Christine Taylor</strong> as Kate Veatch, <strong>Justin Long</strong> as Justin Redman,<strong> Stephen Root</strong> as Gordon Pibb, <strong>Alan Tudyk</strong> as Steve “Pirate” Cowan, <strong>Joel David Moore</strong> as Owen Dittman, <strong>Chris Williams</strong> as Dwight Baumgarten, <strong>Missi Pyle</strong> as Fran Stalinovskovichdaviddivichski, <strong>Gary Cole</strong> as Cotton McKnight, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jason Bateman</strong> </a>as Pepper Brooks, and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> William Shatner</strong></a> as The Dodgeball Chancellor. Given Justin Long’s previous comments about doing a sequel, he’s most likely in.</p><p id=content-paragraph-13>The cast famously reunited in 2017 for a charity drive to benefit the Stiller Foundation. The reunion gave us a little mini-sequel, with Peter LaFleur and White Goodman coming face-to-face once again on the court.</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-14>Justin revealed to ComicBook.com that the 2017 reunion made Ben realize “how happy it made him playing White Goodman again and how much fun that character was. I do know that Vince has a great idea for it and it’s just a matter of getting Ben on board.”</p><h2>Dodgeball 2 Release Date</h2><p id=content-paragraph-15>Dodgeball 2 does not have a release date at the moment. The film is in early development, so the full cast hasn’t been rounded out just yet. Given a potential writers’ strike in May 2023, development could be delayed. If everything went smoothly, we’d probably be looking at a late 2024 or 2025 release date.</p><h2>What Was The First Dodgeball Movie About?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-16>Dodgeball follows Peter LaFleur, the owner of the Average Joe’s gym. When Peter needs to raise $50,000 to keep his gym, he assembles a dodgeball team to enter a tournament in Las Vegas. The grand prize is the $50,000 he needs.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>Peter’s gym owner enemy, White Goodman, gets a whiff of what Peter is doing and decides to form a dodgeball team as well. The Average Joe’s team is left devastated when their coach, Patches O’Houlihan, is killed by a falling sign. After a series of unexpected events, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chuck Norris</strong></a> reinstates the Average Joe’s after they forfeit.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/dodgeball-2-the-cast-ec-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Peter and White go head-to-head in a sudden-death match. Peter wins the game, but White believes he’s got the one-up on Peter because Peter sold Average Joe’s to him the night before. Peter, being incredibly savvy, reveals that he used the $100,000 from White to bet on Average Joe’s winning the tournament. Since everyone bet against them, Peter wins $5 million. Now Peter has a controlling interest in Globo Gym, and he’s able to get Average Joe’s back.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Kate and Pete finally get together, and Justin marries his dream girl Amber. Owen and Fran from Globo Gym’s team begin dating. Peter decides to offer youth dodgeball classes at the gym. Meanwhile, White has become morbidly obese and continues to blame Chuck Norris for how his life has ended up.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8Oom6Cdkpa5rXmRZmxpcGNtf3p7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
