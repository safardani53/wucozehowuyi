development for the <a href=#>fast food</a> chain's traditional locations would prevent the company from reaching its net unit growth until the second half of 2023, per <a href=# aria-label="Restaurant Dive (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Restaurant Dive</a>.</p><p>“In the second quarter, you’ll see [about] 15 US Reef closures,” Penegor said.</p><p>In August 2021, Wendy's <a href=# aria-label="announced (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the building processes for 700 Reef units in the United States, <a href=#>Canada</a>, and the <a href=#>United Kingdom</a>.</p><p>Known as "ghost kitchens," the Reef stations are digital kiosks that allow customers to order from some of their favorite <a href=#>restaurants</a> for delivery only.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on Fast Food">Read More on Fast Food</h2><p>Stadiums and <a href=#>airports</a> like Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina implemented Reef locations over the past year or so, <a href=# aria-label="Restaurant Business Online (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Restaurant Business Online</a> reported.</p><p>Wendy's originally had lofty goals for the Reef "ghost kitchens," plotting out at least 8,500 locations around the globe for 2025.</p><p>In 2022, the fast food chain cut back significantly on its projections, noting only 100 to 150 domestic units by 2025 instead.</p><p>The first quarter of 2023 also saw Wendy's suffer a net loss of five stores, according <a href=# aria-label="to data (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">to data</a> from the earnings call, although Penegor noted that some were shut down for remodeling.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Money</h2></p><p>Now, closures have begun, with interest rates and delivery fees being possible reasons for the chink in Wendy's plans.</p><p>Some experts believe that the March 2022 increase in interest rates by the Federal Reserve, the first since the <a href=#>COVID-19 pandemic</a> began, contributed to Wendy's losses with their "ghost kitchens" as it greatly impacted the <a href=#>tech</a> industry.</p><p>The Federal Reserve made the decision in an effort to slow <a href=#>inflation</a>, but the side effect was <a href=#>significant layoffs</a> in tech.</p><p>Reef Technology allegedly cut five percent of its workforce that year alone, according to Restaurant Dive.</p><p>High delivery fees, along with customers now returning to and frequenting in-person establishments, may have also given deliver-only services little room to <a href=#>profit</a>.</p><p>The U.S. Sun has contacted Wendy's and Reef Technology for comment on the announced closures.</p><p>The renovations that Penegor mentioned also might be closer than customers think, as Wendy's recently revealed <a href=#>its blueprint for an underground delivery system</a> at restaurant locations to get food to vehicles faster.</p><p>The fast food chain partnered with Pipedream, a hyper logistics company, to create and manage the robotic system with the idea of delivering meals to customers in seconds.</p><p>Impressively, the technology would use robots to transport meals underground and deliver them to the car-side&nbsp;Instant Pickup portal.</p><p>Deepak Ajmani, the US chief operations officer at Wendy’s, explained that the "Instant Pickup system has the potential to unlock greater mobile order speed of service and accuracy, enabling us to consistently deliver hot and fresh Wendy's products to our fans.</p><p>"We know that serving orders quickly and accurately leads to increased customer satisfaction."</p><p>Wendy’s plans on integrating Pipedream’s system into one of its existing restaurants later this year.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US
