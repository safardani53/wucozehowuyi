Ashton Kutcher is undoubtedly one of the hunkiest modern-day actors, but he has proudly showed off his “slightly webbed toes” on national TV. During an appearance on Friday Night With Jonathan Ross in 2008, he whipped out his feet and confidently discussed his abnormality.

From deformities to congenital tails, Hollywood’s biggest stars <a href=#>aren’t invincible to having bodily flaws</a>.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Ashton Kutcher</strong></a> is undoubtedly <a href=#>one of the hunkiest modern-day actors</a>, but he has proudly showed off his “slightly webbed toes” on national TV. During an appearance on <a href=#>Friday Night With Jonathan Ross</a> in 2008, he whipped out his feet and confidently discussed his abnormality.</p><p>“I have two toes that are connected, webbed. This made headline news? … They are just a little connected. It is good to tell everyone,” he previously explained. “I heard this one little kid who had webbed toes and he thought he was abnormal but then he saw that I have them too and it confirmed that he is abnormal.”</p><p>The <a href=#>That ‘70s Show</a> alum added, “I thought everyone’s toes were like that. You can actually cut it when you are born. People’s toes are joined then grow apart. Mine just didn’t all the way.”</p><p>Upon taking a closer examination of <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>’s feet, it is <a href=#>easy to spot a deformity</a> that causes her pinky toe to overlap with her ring toe. The condition she has is called brachymetatarsia, which results in shortened toes or a toe bone that overlaps.</p><p>According to <a href=#>Radiopaedia</a>, brachymetatarsia is rare and mostly affects people who are born female. The health matter can be resolved through various lengthening treatments, but some individuals who have the disorder don’t experience any pain or discomfort.</p><p><a href=#><strong>Denzel Washington</strong></a>, meanwhile, gained a crooked pinky finger following an incident that occurred in his childhood. Back in 2014, Washington opened up about his finger injury on <a href=#>The Graham Norton Show</a>. “I had it rebuilt. I had injured it so many times playing football, American football,” he explained. “It’s fine now, but it’s like a gummy bear in there. Like, a little piece of rubber candy.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Fences actor added, “When my kids were young, they would ask me, ‘Daddy, could you show my friends the magic finger?’”</p><p>Scroll through the gallery below to discover more about what deformities some celebrities have.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZJunlK58sbXCrayrnaNkwLWt0axksKGknXq4scirm2aan5nGbrzAq6usZWJlfnR%2BlHJm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
