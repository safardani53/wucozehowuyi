" I hadn’t been with anyone except my boyfriend and my ex before that, so it was a strange feeling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000461109938.jpg><p>"With the first guy, I took pictures and videos that we sent to Paul. The second meet up, with Jared, was different – I fell for him, and my boyfriend noticed that I had become distant so we decided not to use the site anymore.</p><p>"But I couldn’t ignore my feelings and still chatted to Jared over Snapchat. Eventually, he broke up with his long-term girlfriend and I broke up with Paul. We kept seeing each other for seven months.</p><p>"The outcome of joining definitely wasn’t what we’d intended as a couple, but I don’t regret any of it."</p><p>But there are plenty of successful sex-only stories on Fab Swingers that didn’t end with broken hearts.<br></p><h2>'I'm married but have slept with two dozen swingers'</h2><p>Elliott*, 42, works in facilities management and has been a member for almost a decade. He’s married, but the pair aren’t able to have sex because his wife has a medical condition.</p><p>She agreed that he could sign up to fulfil his sexual needs, and Elliott has now slept with over 20 people from the site, many of whom have provided very high praise on his profile.</p><p>One woman described Elliott as "truly a pleasure, in all aspects of the word", while another said he has "strong hands that hit all the right spots". He has 14 positive verifications in total.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/NINTCHDBPICT000461109934.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">more stories</h2></p><p>Whether you’re after a lasting relationship, a quick one-night-stand, a couple to get frisky with or to switch partners, Fab Swingers has a lot to offer.</p><p>And if you’re not pleased post-swinging session, you always have the pleasure of leaving a scathing review.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e9GemKVlnJ6zpnuXam1yb2lrfKetwWaqsKGenLKzv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
