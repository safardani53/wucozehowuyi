Before getting together over the summer, both Eve and Taggart made headlines for their past relationships with other stars. In March 2021, the “Paris” singer — who was previously linked to Meredith Mickelson and Haley Rowe — split from Chantel Jeffries after one year of dating."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Chainsmokers released their fourth studio album, So Far So Good, in May, and kicked off a series of shows this month that will take them across the country and to Europe through early 2023. Eve, for her part, signed with DNA Models in early March — the top agency that also represents <a href=#><strong>Kaia Gerber</strong></a>.</p><p>Last month, the equestrian — who <a href=#>lost her father to pancreatic cancer</a> in 2011 — got candid about carving her own career path. (Her mom is <strong>Laurene Powell Jobs</strong>, who co-founded Apple with her late husband.)</p><p>“I never foresaw modeling, and on a whim, I was like, ‘Why not?’” she told <a href=#>Vanity Fair,</a> adding, “It drew upon things I knew, igniting the part of me that competing [as an equestrian] always did.”</p><p>Eve, who currently lives in New York City, also wanted to showcase her personality to the world.</p><p>“I’m a little weird,” she told the outlet. “Some people get a little taken aback by me: ‘I don’t know where to place her.’ But humor makes you feel like you are living.”</p><p>The New York resident made headlines earlier this month when she took to her Instagram Story with that exact brand of humor. In the since-deleted upload, Eve poked fun at the latest iPhone model when sharing a meme about the new Apple product.</p><p>“Me upgrading from ‌‌iPhone 13‌‌ to ‌‌iPhone 14‌‌ after Apple’s announcement today,” read the caption, which was posted underneath a photo of a man holding up an identical shirt to the one he is wearing.</p><p>Despite the humorous dig at her late dad’s company, the California native honors her dad with her collection of vintage Apple T-shirts — including one that bears her name.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Eve had the right idea,” the front of the garment reads, while the back of the shirt is emblazoned with the words: “She picked an Apple.”</p><p>“It means so much to me,” she told Vanity Fair. “I smile every time I wear it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWrsm62zpuqZpyRqrSpwMSrZJ6ulWK3sK7SZpuarJmjtG6vx5qgp6udpLimvtJmm6udp2LBorPGmqmtZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
