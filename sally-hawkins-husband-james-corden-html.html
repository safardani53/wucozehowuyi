He then revealed,&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>We've made a deal that if we're both single at 35, we'll have babies and get married.</p><h2>Sally Hawkins and James Corden Had Chemistry</h2><p>Corden and Hawkins hit it off when they&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">were both cast</a>&nbsp;in the Mike Leigh film&nbsp;All or Nothing&nbsp;that came out in 2002. The lead cast members included Timothy Spall and Lesley Manville.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The plot was centered around three working-class families living ordinary lives in London. While Corden played the son of the characters played by Spall and Manville, Hawkins was cast as the daughter of one of the other families.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The two had an amicable relationship and grew even closer as they hosted the BAFTA Craft Awards together back in 2008. So the pact was rightly in place.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>However, Corden and Hawkins being husband and wife never really happened because Corden found love elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><h2>James Corden Was Almost Sally Hawkins' Husband</h2><p>Today, Corden is the husband of Julia Carey, whom he married in 2012. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>As per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">reports from Good Housekeeping</a>, Carey met her husband for the first time at a charity function back in 2009.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>At the time, Carey, whose most notable performance was in the '90s sitcom&nbsp;Wings, was working with the non-profit Save the Children.&nbsp;</p><p>Dominic Cooper, a good friend of Corden, was invited to the event and convinced Corden to come with. While they were there, Cooper introduced Carey to her would-be husband. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><h2><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-5 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>James Corden Wasted No Time</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>During an interview with People, Corden recalled the first encounter he had with Carey. The conversation sounded much like how it would play out in a movie.&nbsp;</p><p>As soon as they got the greetings out of the way, Corden told his future wife that she might be the most beautiful woman in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>"She said, 'Well, thank you very much. That sounds like something you say a lot,'" he recalled, "And I said, 'I've never said it before in my life.'"</p><p>Just like that, Corden found himself gravitating towards Carey. To Corden's surprise, so did she.</p><p>Less than two hours into their conversation, Corden and Carey were "jokingly" plotting out how they would spend the rest of their lives together.</p><p>They bonded over their love of quiet, uneventful nights. Corden recalled,&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_5"></span><p>I remember saying to her, ‘Well, what about on Friday we could do nothing together? You could come over and we could just do nothing. And then maybe we could do nothing on the Saturday, and we could do nothing on the Sunday. And if our evenings are enough of nothing, then maybe this would become something.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Carey seemed to like the idea, and they began dating shortly after. On Christmas Day 2010, Corden popped the question to his then-pregnant girlfriend. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>By March the following year, they were parents to a beautiful baby boy, Max.&nbsp;</p><p>The two got married in September 2012 in Somerset, England. Years later, James and Julia had two daughters, Carey and Charlotte.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKuRobm6ecearqShnqh6qcHSm5innF2frq6x0maaqKqUmrtvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
