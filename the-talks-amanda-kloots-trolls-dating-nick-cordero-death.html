There’s too much to say and too much that widows deal with to not talk about it.</p><p>“Until then, I will call out anyone who is rude enough to comment like this.”</p><p>During the chat show, Amanda talked about dating and how it was really foreign to her.</p><p>“Both of my husbands, I met doing Broadway shows. We became friends first, then we got married. Obviously with Nick, we had a child,” Amanda expleained.</p><p>She said she met Nick very shortly after splitting from ex-husband&nbsp;David Larsen and so she “never actually had to date.”</p><p>“I just started dating again and it is so crazy to be dating for the first time at 39 years old," Amanda told her co-hosts.</p><p>"It’s quite terrifying and really out of your element, and it’s just hard/</p><p>“It’s wonderful people I’m meeting, and it’s been a great process so far. But I’ll just say it’s very hard without getting into too many details.”</p><p>Nick died from&nbsp;<a href=#>Covid-19</a>&nbsp;complications at the age of 41 during the summer of 2020.</p><p>He was taken to the hospital emergency room by his wife and&nbsp;<a href=#>lost his battle with the virus</a>&nbsp;a little more than three months later.</p><p>Amanda recalled that visit to the Los Angeles ER one year later.</p><p>"With Covid restrictions in place, we didn’t know which entrance was even open, so I left him on the corner. We didn’t hug. We didn’t kiss goodbye," she wrote on Instagram on March 30, 2021.</p><p>"We couldn’t. It was clear he was sick with something and we couldn’t take any risks.</p><p>"I don’t even know if he said bye to&nbsp;<a href=#>Elvis</a>&nbsp;or if we said, “I love you.” I told him I’d stay nearby and to call me when he’s done.</p><p>"We walked to The Grove to kill time. We thought it would be a couple hours.</p><p>"That was the last day I saw Nick as Nick."</p><p>Amanda and Nick share a young son Elvis, who was born in 2019.</p><p>"My heart breaks today," Amanda, also a dancer and fitness instructor, continued in the Instagram post.</p><p>"I wish I could go back in time, run to him as he was walking away, grab him, kiss him and hold him in my arms.</p><p>"On April 1, he went on the ventilator and I never spoke to him again."</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Nick was&nbsp;<a href=#>nominated for a Tony Award</a>&nbsp;for his performance in the 2014 Broadway musical Bullets Over Broadway and was twice nominated for Drama Desk Awards.</p><p>It was during the Bullets Over Broadway run that Amanda and Nick met before falling in love.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000598485545.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000583404691.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000668065065.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/07/NINTCHDBPICT000620065424.jpg><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>The Talk's Amanda Kloots breaks down in tears about being a 'single parent' after husband Nick Cordero's Covid death</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hrY2mCcX2XaKuhnV2prq230maYppmema5ut8uopq2rXam%2FsLjLrGSdmaSeu6h5zaKapGWTpL%2BlsdGoZJ2dkam1cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
