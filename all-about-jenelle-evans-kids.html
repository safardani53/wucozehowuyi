Not long after Jace's birth, Evans signed over custody of her son, whose father was not in the picture, to her mom Barbara.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The young mom went on to welcome two more children: son Kaiser Orion, 9, with her ex-boyfriend Nathan Griffith, and daughter Ensley Jolie, 6, with her husband David Eason.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2019, Evans temporarily lost custody of her two younger children after her husband, Eason, allegedly shot and killed their family dog for biting their then-2-year-old daughter in the face. That July, the reality star confirmed to PEOPLE she had <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>regained custody</a> of Kaiser and Ensley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Throughout this long process and final decision, I am excited to be moving forward and continuing to show America I'm a good parent," Jenelle told PEOPLE in a statement.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jenelle Evans Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evans remained on Teen Mom 2 until she was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fired by MTV</a> due to the incident. In September 2022, she made a brief appearance in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Teen Mom: The Next Chapter</a>, but left the show shortly after.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After 13 years, Evans <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>regained full custody of her eldest child</a>, Jace, in March 2023.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"#MyHappyEnding, ITS OFFICIAL!

At the time, Evans was filming 16 and Pregnant and still dating his father, Andrew Lewis. However, the pair split shortly after Jace's birth and Lewis was not involved in Jace's life.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With Jace's father out of the picture and Evans struggling with issues in her personal life, she signed over custody of Jace to her mother.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, Evans has spoken openly about how <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>not having custody of Jace</a> has been difficult for her. "This persona that I'm just a bad mom... I do everything in my world for my kids, and I try my hardest to be the best damn mom I can be," she said on Instagram in October 2022.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After 13 years and many custody disputes with her mom, Evans <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>regained full custody of Jace</a> in March 2023. She posted an emotional video of her signing the papers on Instagram, explaining her mom Barbara is "completely fine" with the decision.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"She's like, 'I'm ready to have my freedom. I'm ready to go on a cruise.' And her and her friend have a cruise already planned," Evans said in the video.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite living with Barbara for much of his childhood, Jace has still spent plenty of time with his mom and his two younger siblings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In August 2022, the whole family celebrated Jace's 13th birthday with a day of dirt biking. The festivities even included a dirt bike themed-cake.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"JACE IS 13 YEARS OLD 🤯💗😭 #HappyBirthday #MindBlown," Evans wrote alongside a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video compilation</a> of the day.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In addition to dirt biking, Jace is also into sports, particularly soccer. In May 2022, Evans shared selfies of the mother-son duo at one of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Jace's soccer games</a>.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-kaiser-orion-griffith-9></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Kaiser Orion Griffith, 9</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jenelle Evans Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evans' second son, Kaiser Orion Griffith, was born on June 30, 2014, to Evans and her ex-boyfriend Nathan Griffith.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former couple broke up in August 2015 and have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fought over custody of Kaiser</a> several times over the years. Currently, Evans has primary custody of Kaiser, while Griffith has his son every other weekend, according to a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>custody agreement settled</a> in October 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When speaking to PEOPLE about her past pregnancies, Evans revealed that she had a hard time with Kaiser's delivery.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"One time I almost lost it during pregnancy, it was my second son, Kaiser," Evans said. "The epidural just didn't work and they came in and fixed it, [but] it didn't work again. So, they just said 'Welp, we just got to do it.' So, I did it natural birth, and it was the worst pain in my life."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Kaiser was little, he had some health scares which Evans opened up about on Instagram, including an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>infected abscess in his groin</a> when he was 6 years old, as well as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>surgery to remove adenoids</a> when he was 4 years old.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now at age 8, Kaiser is happy and healthy. In July 2022, he had his first day of third grade. The proud mom shared photos of him and his sister Ensley as they <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>headed off to school</a>. "I'm not crying, you're crying! All my babies are officially in school now 😭📚💗 #FirstDayOfSchool," Evans wrote in the caption.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-ensley-jolie-eason-6></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Ensley Jolie Eason, 6</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Jenelle Evans Instagram</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evans and her husband David Eason, whom she married in September 2017, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>welcomed their daughter</a>, Ensley Jolie Eason, on Jan. 24, 2017.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A few days after her birth, Evans shared photos from a photo shoot with her newborn daughter. "We made something so beautiful," she captioned a photo of her and Eason lying in a bed with baby Ensley.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2019, when Ensley was just 2 years old, the family's dog Nugget <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>bit her in the face</a>, prompting Eason to shoot and kill the dog. The controversy led to Evans being <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>fired from </a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Teen Mom 2</a>. Eason had already been <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>fired in 2018 after posting homophobic tweets</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the incident, Evans also briefly <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lost custody of both Ensley and Kaiser</a>. Reflecting on the situation on Instagram, the mom of three wrote, "It's the little things in life. With everything that has been going on lately, I've come to realize a child's love for their mother will never fade. No distance, not time, no person can change that special love."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Evans <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>regained custody of Ensley and Kaiser</a> in July 2019. "I am ecstatic to regain custody of my kids back!" she said in a statement.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-67 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In January 2022, Ensley turned 6 years old. Her mom <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrated her birthday</a> on Instagram, writing alongside a series of photos of Ensley: "How did 6 years go by THAT quick?! You're the most sweetest and caring little girl I know! The love she has for her family is amazing. You will go so far some day when you're older and I can't wait to see where that big personality is going to take you!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-69 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ensley also appears to have a passion for makeup and perhaps a future career as a makeup artist. In April 2022, Evans shared a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>video of Ensley</a> giving herself a makeover, captioned: "Little #MUA n the making! 💄💗."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In May 2023, Evans celebrated <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ensley's kindergarten graduation</a> with an Instagram post. She shared family photos from the event, including snaps of the little girl in a cap and gown. "My baby is going to 1st grade! 😭🎓❤️&nbsp;#KindergartenGraduation," the proud mom wrote in the caption.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6CWv6a606xmmqScYq6ju9StZKOdnpq5rbGMnq2apqNiuKqw0mg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
