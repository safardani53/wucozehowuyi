The team is led by Kevin Gibson (played by Kevin James), and a series of comedic events unfold after Bobby Spencer steps down and lets his daughter have full control over the team. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>In the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">trailer</a>, Kevin says that Chuck was like a brother to him, and the video cuts to Chuck poking a screwdriver into food and licking it, demonstrating his quirky character. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>Williams&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">described</a>&nbsp;his character as a mechanic whose sole focus is on getting the car to run. “Chuck’s thing is, ‘I am going to make this car run.’ This new, fancy stuff? He’s not into that … Chuck doesn’t have any time for fancy-schmancy stuff, or the new hood sponsor that she’s got coming. That’s just not part of his M.O.”</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The Crew adopts the style of the olden comedy shows where laughter sounds play in the background whenever something funny happens. Because of it, many viewers expressed their disapproval of the choice. Aside from that, the thing that caught the audience off guard the most might be how Williams looks on the show. The Malcolm In The Middle actor looks to be in the best shape he has ever been, and it’s no surprise that fans were impressed by his transformation. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p></p><p>Gary Anthony Williams in The Crew (Photo: The Crew's <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">trailer</a>)</p><p>One fan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">tweeted</a> about his transformation: “OMG! Gary Anthony Williams looks soooo good! Go guy!!!! I thought he looked familiar! #TheCrew” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Another <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">praised</a> him for his performance: “Finished #TheCrew Such a great funny show - When Jake was doing the Fake Steak commercial, I almost choked on my food. I’m sure I’ve seen Gary Anthony Williams before, but he’s one of the BEST - he goes all out on this show! Instant fav! Now wait for more eps…..”</p><h2>Williams’ Weight Loss Journey</h2><p>Williams weighed in at&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">360 pounds</a>&nbsp;in 2001. The event that pushed him to lose weight was his routine physical in April of the same year where his doctor told him, “I can’t weigh you on this scale. It doesn’t go that high.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The doctor’s comment served as a wake-up call for&nbsp;The Crew&nbsp;actor, who then decided to get in shape. Williams cut down on carbs and worked out daily. In just a year, he had shed over 50 lbs of weight. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p>Gary Anthony Williams before weight loss transformation (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">IMDB</a>)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Since then, he has been losing weight gradually and weighed <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">195 pounds</a> in 2018. Given how he looks in The Crew, Williams should have lost a couple more pounds. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5yus8WMmqWtoJ%2Bjxm7DyKWjopmdqHq4scign61lnKTAtHrHraSl</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
