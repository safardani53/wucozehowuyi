Both pictures were shot by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Spencer Tunick</strong></a>. The only thing that seems to have changed in the three decades between them is that Andy no longer has a lion’s mane of hair on his head, as he did in the original shoot.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Andy-Cohen-Skin-Cancer-Photoshoot-ST-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Taking to his <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> to promote the collaboration on Wednesday, May 17, he wrote, “Thirty years ago, I posed for photographer @spencertunick (swipe for that image). And I did it again… May is #SkinCancerAwareness Month and I’m partnering with @eltamdskincare to remind you all to wear sunscreen and #GetNaked… for a skin check with your dermatologist.” Prompting some follower participation, he added, “Tag your friends who need this reminder in the comments! For every tag in the next 30 days, @eltamdskincare will donate a bottle of sunscreen to the @curemelanoma foundation, up to $100,000 in value #EltaMDPartner”.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Andy was diagnosed with skin cancer in 2016 after a visit to the dermatologist that was prompted by fellow television host, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kelly Ripa</strong></a>. “There was a dot on my lip that I had for a while that I was not paying attention to. I was at an art opening for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gloria Vanderbilt</strong></a>,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Anderson [Cooper’s]</strong></a>&nbsp;mom, and Kelly and<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Mark [Consuelos]</strong></a> were there. Kelly came up to me and goes, ‘What’s happening with your lip?’ I go ‘I don’t know.’ She goes, ‘Get that checked out today. That is skin cancer,” he recalled to<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong> Jenny McCarthy</strong></a> <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>on her radio show</a> in 2020. He was diagnosed with<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> malignant melanoma</a>, a deadly form of skin cancer. Luckily, he had it removed and hasn’t had such a scare since that the public knows about.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>The<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> father of two</a> further opened up about the impact his cancer diagnosis had on him in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Ellle</a>. “My bout with skin cancer completely changed my relationship with the sun. I spent many years worshipping the sun, which turned out to be a very toxic relationship!” he said in an article published on May 17. “I don’t lay out in the sun anymore, obviously, and I’m really careful about taking care of my skin in and out of the sun.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Andy also gave some insight into this original photoshoot with Spencer. “The original photo was taken as I was preparing to cut off a head of hair I’d been growing for years,” he remembered. “I wanted to commemorate that I had it. A pal hooked me up with Spencer, who pitched the idea of showcasing my lion’s mane in front of the lion at the NYPL.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e5BwZpqmlK56pLvHnqVmqJ%2BosrR5za6bnmWerrBuv8qipWabkaOwpr6Mmq6aqpWjsrS%2FjKmfqKyfqLWwu9No</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
