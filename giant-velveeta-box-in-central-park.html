"SERIOUSLY IT'S IN CENTRAL PARK GO CHECK IT OUT."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Velveeta masterpiece isn't made from 186 kilograms of pure 24-karat gold like Castello's box, nor is it worth the whopping $11.7 million his piece was said to be valued at. However, just like the cube, Velveeta's box has its own security team.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It might not be $11.7 million worth of 'pure gold' but it certainly is gold in its own right," Velveeta said in a release, noting that their gold brick of cheese is known for its "velvety richness and cheesy, melty goodness" — which some would say is priceless. "We ask that all respect the drip."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">They also admitted in their release that they were inspired by Castello.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The brand is all about encouraging people to be confident, unapologetically themselves, and constantly reminds us that you don't have to live rich to be golden and lead a lavish, pleasure-filled life," they added.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cindy Ord/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Castello's cube — which weighs over 400 lbs., measures just over a foot and a half on all sides, and is only about a quarter-inch thick — <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>made headlines</a> when it appeared in Central Park on Wednesday.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"[The work] is a conceptual work of art in all its facets," Castello told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noopener>ArtNews</a> in a statement, adding that he was inspired to "create something that is beyond our world — that is intangible."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In order to make the piece, gold was purchased at $1,788 per ounce. The cube was cast at a foundry in Aarau, Switzerland, in a special handmade kiln built to hold both the volume of the gold and the box's large size. In order to melt the materials, high temperatures hitting at 1,100 degrees Celsius were also needed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for</strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong> </strong><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After its trip to Central Park, Castello's cube was showed off at a private dinner on Wall Street on Wednesday evening.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The cube helped promote a cryptocurrency called the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Castello Coin</a>, which is now for sale. An NFT auction is also scheduled for Feb. 21.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">No word on whether Velvetta will be following suit in those areas as well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5akvKV7xqKYp6xdq7KtwsSeq5plkqTFbrXNZpqepqSnrq15z5qppGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
