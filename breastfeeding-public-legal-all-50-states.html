However, the bill does not make it completely clear, as other states have done, that women have the right to breastfeed in public.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, issues with the wording notwithstanding, with these two pieces of legislation it is <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>officially legal to breastfeed in public</a> in all 50 states. The United States is now up to speed with the U.K., Australia and other countries across the world that protect nursing mothers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2iZq52RqMGnscSdoKefXaXCo7jInGSlnZeWuW6ty6VkbmhdqMGiwMSsZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
