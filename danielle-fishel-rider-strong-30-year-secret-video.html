So … I was your first celebrity crush. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jonathan Taylor Thomas</strong></a> and me. You really had the teen magazine thing covered way through the ’90s.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>“It is too true,” Danielle continued, sharing her sincere thoughts on her former costar and current cohost. <span>“I think it started maybe later in season 1 and definitely through season two. I did. I had a crush on Rider. I don’t know — he was so smart. You know one of my favorite things about Rider, and it still stands to this day, Rider is very effusive. He will tell you how he feels and he’s very free with his compliments, but he doesn’t throw them out willy-nilly. When Rider compliments you it is thoughtful, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>it has meaning</a>, and you can tell…it’s coming from a very real place.”&nbsp;</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>The crush evidently spilled over into an acting class they took together, as well. “I remember getting a very real compliment from Rider,” she revealed. “And then feeling like, ‘Oh, my God, I love you.'” <span>While noting that she might have </span><span>“annoyed” Rider when she <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>first began playing Topanga</a>, Danielle said that the relationship matured into, “a very nice, deep friendship and we had very meaningful conversations.”</span></p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Boy Meets World ran from 1993-2000. Danielle went on to star in the spinoff Girl Meets World from 2014 and 2017, with Rider reprising his role as Shawn in recurring spots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH15e5FvZp2Znp6yrbjEZp2iq5iauW6%2ByJ2cq2Wjqb%2BwusZmamllqZqus3nSnpqrnaRiw6qwxKhm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
