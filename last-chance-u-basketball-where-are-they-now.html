The season gives fans what they've come to expect from the first rendition of the show: the perfect combination of sports and emotions. Viewers get the chance to really sympathize with the players as they take on the court.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Even though a second season of the Netflix original Last Chance U: Basketball hasn't been confirmed yet, fans are already wondering what's happened with the players they followed for eight episodes. Even though filming ended in 2020, there's still so much going on with these players today.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where are the players from 'Last Chance U: Basketball' now?</h2><p>Even though the players have gone their own ways, it looks like they're all doing really well. KJ Allen, who was a small forward on the L.A. team, decided to continue his college career and basketball dreams at the University of Southern California. He thanked God, his friends, and his family for getting him where he is today in an October 2020, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>. "Everyone has been a great help getting me to this point in my life," the post said in part.&nbsp;</p><p>"Third, I like to thank all the schools who recruited me. This decision was not easy. So with that being said, I am 110% committed to the University of Southern California. Go Trojans!!"</p><p>Joe Hampton was a power forward on the show, but he ended up spending a few years away from the Division 1 basketball court. Now, he's playing at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Long Beach State University</a> as a forward and earned his team 19 points in a February 2021 game. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Deshaun Highler, a shooting guard, made it into his first-choice school: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sacramento State</a> and plays guard there. Malik Muhammad, a center on the Netflix series, has been a forward at Central Michigan University.&nbsp;</p><p>Marquis Copeland, who was a forward on the show, now goes to school at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NYACK College</a> and plays basketball there. Jordan Polynice, another forward, and LJ Zeigler, a guard, both went to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicago State University</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is John Mosley?</h2><p>Head coach of the East Los Angeles College team John Mosley obviously didn't go off to college himself. The following basketball season was suspended because of COVID-19 concerns, but he's now got new players to get into shape.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, there's still no word on whether or not there will be a second season of Last Chance U: Basketball. But since John's got a whole new team, there's hope for the future of the docuseries.&nbsp;</p><p>But there may be another reason for John to want to do a second season of Last Chance U: Basketball. In fact, it was John's pastor who persuaded him to do the show in the first place. "Ultimately, [it was] my pastor, of all people," John said in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Wrap</a>. "You would assume a pastor may say, 'No, we don’t want the spotlight, we want to be humble.' But he said, 'Share that message. Share what God is doing to your life and share how you impacted those young men.'"</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa60wIycn5qmk5p6tnnBmqqknaSXrq24jLCfnqqVYq6zsYytn56xXaO8uA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
