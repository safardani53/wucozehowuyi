The event supported the <a href=#>Only Murders in the Building</a> star’s non-profit organization, the Rare Impact Fund, which works to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health and expand access to mental health services and education for young people.</p><p>“This has been the culmination of a lifelong dream for me, but it has also stemmed from some of the darkest moments in my life,” <a href=#>the former Disney Channel star told the crowd.</a></p><p>“I struggled with the world inside my head for a long time and I felt lost and I felt hopeless at times. In 2020, I received my diagnosis of bipolar disorder, and, to be honest, everything quickly changed,” Gomez continued.</p><p>The singer/actress has been very open about her mental health challenges which inspired her to form her Rare Impact charity.</p><p>“I actually got the knowledge and the answers I had been desperate for so long, and understanding that obviously makes me become more aware of it, and I’m less afraid than I used to be,” she added. “With that knowledge, I could seek out the support I needed to be myself, to find my joy again, and tonight I’m very proud to say that I have. I’m working really hard every day and I’m so happy just to be alive and be here with you guys today.”</p><p><strong><a href=#>Martin Short</a>,</strong> Gomez’s Only Murders in the Building costar, served as emcee and auctioneer for the evening.</p><p>“I am proud to call Selena Gomez my friend, and not because she’s successful or rich; because she’s both,” said the Canadian actor, 73. “What makes tonight very important is we’re here to support youth mental health awareness,” he added.</p><p>“I don’t think there’s anyone in this room that hasn’t been touched by mental health and its issues and the pain it can bring a family. We are here to raise urgent funds for the young people who need them.”</p><p>Another member of the Only Murders in the Building cast, <a href=#><strong>Stevie Martin</strong></a>, auctioned a signed banjo, while fellow cast member <a href=#><strong>Paul Rudd</strong> </a>donated a fan experience: a movie night with himself, for $5,000.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Other auction items included a signed jersey from <a href=#>soccer star <strong>Lionel Messi</strong> </a>and VIP tickets to <a href=#><strong>Luke Combs</strong></a>’ Growin’ Up and Gettin’ Old concert tour in Los Angeles.</p><p>The Rare Impact Fund, <a href=#>which Gomez founded in 2020</a>, has a goal of raising $100 million over the next 10 years to improve mental health services for young people around the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatmamhvLN50rCgn6xdmbyvrdOeqmaumaV6pr7ArGStp6WnerW1wqScratdqbxuv8SlnKeZXZy8rrHZZpqhmaKewbp5xa6lnWViZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
