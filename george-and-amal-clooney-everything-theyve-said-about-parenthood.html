After heading back to Italy for a <a href=#>fairytale&nbsp;wedding in September 2014</a>, Us confirmed in February 2017 that <a href=#>Amal was pregnant</a>.</p><p>“The first thing you think is, ‘I hope I don’t screw this up.’ I mean, look, we are all responsible for things in life, and Amal and I are responsible for each other in a way — we look out for one another and we care about one another,” <a href=#>the actor told&nbsp;The Hollywood Reporter&nbsp;in September 2017</a> after his twins were born. “But you are really responsible for two kids. I want them to be happy. I want them to have a sense of humor. I want them to be interested in things. I want them to be compassionate about other people’s plights. Because that’s the thing, you know? You have to have some sort of empathy.”</p><p>Now that they’re a little older, however, the couple can be sure their children are growing up just fine.</p><p>“They’re good kids,” the Oscar winner said on the <a href=#>Today </a>show in May 2019. “They really come out with the personalities that they’re born with. They’re just completely different personalities, and they’re fun and smart. I mean, they already can … do all their ABC’s in Italian and in English, and I can’t do that in English.”</p><p>The Lebanon native and the Argo actor “are pretty even about how they divide up the parenting responsibilities,” a <a href=#>source revealed exclusively to Us Weekly </a>in April 2021, adding that George is always “doting” on the twins.</p><p>“[He’s] always thinking of gestures to make them feel appreciated and reminding them that their mom’s the boss,” they said.</p><p>As far as more kids go, “It’s a ‘never say never’ situation,” according to the insider. “[George is] happy with what he’s got and so is Amal.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For now, at least, George enjoys being viewed as cool by his kids. “They’re 5, so right now, I am golden,” he told <a href=#>Extra</a> in December 2022. Amal confirmed his words by adding, “They say, ‘Papa can fix everything but the weather.’ He can solve all of their problems and is the funniest person they have met.”</p><p>From jokes about barf to their twins’ first words, scroll through for the couple’s best quotes about parenthood:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8sbXCrayrnaNktKa70aCcZpmemXqiucClZJykn6S7psWMnq2eqqmptaq6xmaroZ2pq7Juv8Cim2aZkqTCtXnPmqmepqSdvLCwjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
