Since 2014, John has hosted Last Week Tonight with John Oliver&nbsp;on HBO, which has earned him over a dozen Emmy Awards. On his show, John breaks down the news cycle with satirical skits that sometimes feature his fake wife Wanda Jo Oliver, played by <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Rachel Dratch</strong></a>. In real life, John is married to <strong>Kate Norley</strong>, an American and U.S. Armed Forces veteran.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/John-Olivers-Wife-Kate-Norley-ss-embed-1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>John and Kate’s marriage is a true love story for the ages. Below,&nbsp;<strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>has rounded up everything you need to know about Kate and her marriage to John Oliver.</p><h2>Who Is Kate Norley?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Kate Norley enlisted in the U.S. Army when she was just 19 years old. She wanted to serve her country after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Kate worked as both a combat medic and a&nbsp;mental health specialist when she was in Iraq, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Sun</a>. Once she returned to the U.S., Kate dedicated herself towards veteran support by working with the organization&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Vets for Freedom</a>. Kate is a <a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Republican</a>, while her husband is a Democrat.</p><h2>How Did John Oliver Meet Kate?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>John and Kate met in&nbsp;2008 at the Republican National Convention. John was covering the event for&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Show</a>, while Kate was there promoting Vets for Freedom. John, who is British, had a temporary work visa at the time, and he was nearly deported that night if it wasn’t for Kate. Kate and a group of veterans helped hide John from the security team who caught him in a restricted area and would’ve arrested him, according to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Beast</a>. John and Kate hit it off that night and they started dating shortly after!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/John-Olivers-Wife-Kate-Norley-ss-embed-2.jpg><h2>John and Kate’s Marriage</h2><p id=content-paragraph-6>John and Kate got engaged in July 2010 in St. Thomas. After the engagement, Kate told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>,&nbsp;“I was a medic in the Army. It was difficult, but right now it’s nice that I get to spend time with the love of my life.” John said, “It’s the most emasculating thing I could possibly do to go out with someone who has actually done something valuable with their life.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>One year after their engagement, John and Kate tied the knot in October 2011 in a private ceremony. John and Kate have kept the details about their wedding private over the years.</p><h2>John and Kate’s Children</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>John and Kate share two sons, born in 2015 and 2018. Their first son,&nbsp;<strong>Hudson</strong>, was born prematurely. “Kate was in the hospital, it was very difficult for months beforehand,” Oliver told the <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood Reporter</a>&nbsp;about Kate’s pregnancy. “And doing the show at the same time, it was the absolute worst… It was a surreal experience,” he added. John didn’t reveal Hudson’s birth until over a year and a half later. “I have a son. He is 19 months old. He was born prematurely following a very difficult pregnancy,” he said on an episode of&nbsp;Last Week Tonight.&nbsp;John also kept his second son’s birth a secret until his child was three months old. He shared the news to <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a> at the 2018 Emmy Awards Governors Ball.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>John eventually explained why he didn’t outright announce his sons’ births on&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jimmy Fallon</strong></a>‘s talk show in Nov. 2018. “We didn’t really announce it because it doesn’t matter,” he said on the talk show. “To me, it matters a great deal. Let me make that clear.” John further said, “This is not a royal baby. In terms of how far in line he is to the throne, it’s a peasant. I have a peasant child. So it didn’t even cross my mind that we should make a public thing about it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8mon6dln6G2t7HRZq6inpVignGBk3BoaWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
