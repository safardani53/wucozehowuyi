They first got engaged in Nov. 2006, though they announced that they broke up in Feb. 2009. In June 2010, they announced that their engagement was back on, and they got married that same month. They had their first son, Noah, in Sept. 2012. Sadly, the duo officially announced their split on Aug. 19, 2015 after&nbsp;being together for 11 years. Brian and Megan&nbsp;reportedly decided on going their separate ways in&nbsp;February 2015 and made the sad announcement six months later. It was revealed in April 2015 that Megan was pregnant with her third child, although the father has not been confirmed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGianqSVl3yuscaapWaen618dXs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
