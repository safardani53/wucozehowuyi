The couple, who tied the knot in 2017, welcomed babies back-to-back in 2019 and 2020 but it wasn’t easy.</p><p>Ahead of their daughter Elle’s arrival in May 2020, Vander reflected on the road to a healthy second child.</p><p>“Happy Mother’s Day to all the amazing moms out there,” <a href=#>she wrote via Instagram</a>, sharing a photo of her firstborn, Aiden. “Two years ago, I had <a href=#>back-to-back miscarriages</a>, now I’m few days away from having baby number ✌.”</p><p>The <a href=#>real estate agent</a> added: “To all the women who are trying to get pregnant, don’t give up and stay positive🙏❤.”</p><p>After welcoming baby No. 2, Vander exclusively told <a href=#>Us Weekly</a> that she wasn’t sure if a third child was in the cards for the pair.</p><p>“We’re going back and forth because, look, it’s a lot of work,” she said in November 2020. “Both me and my husband are very busy, which is a good thing. I do like a big family. That being said, I don’t know. We’ll see. I’m 50/50 with that.”</p><p>The Israel native joked that her desire to have baby No. 3 “depends what day you’re gonna ask me that question,” pointing to her crying daughter in the background as a reason for her hesitation.</p><p>Eight months later, Vander <a href=#>revealed via Instagram that she was pregnant</a>, calling her future child the couple’s “Christmas/ Chanukah present!” However, the businesswoman <a href=#>suffered a stillborn delivery</a> a few weeks prior to her baby’s due date.</p><p>“Yesterday was the hardest day of my life. I had a stillbirth at 38 weeks. I always heard of it but never imagined I’ll be part of the statistics,” Vander announced via social media in December 2021. “Instead of delivering a baby, I get to go home with a memory box. I do not wish this on anyone.” She revealed that the family’s late son, Mason, would “always be in our heart” as they tried to pick up the pieces.</p><p>Two weeks later, Vander <a href=#>gave insight into how she and Miller were coping</a>. “Our family is taking it one day at a time and we are just trying our best for the kids,” she wrote via Instagram on Christmas.</p><p>The duo’s relationship was again tested in June 2022 after <a href=#>Vander revealed she suffered a miscarriage</a> when she was 10 weeks pregnant. She noted at the time that the pair’s son and daughter have been a bright light in the darkness.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“My kids and my husband are absolutely my blessing and I am so lucky to be their mother!!” Vander wrote via her Instagram Story. “They bring joy and happiness to my life!!
