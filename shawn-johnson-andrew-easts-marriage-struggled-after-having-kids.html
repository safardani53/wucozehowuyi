Just because you’re now sharing your spouse with someone else … and you have someone who consumes all of your time.”</p><p>The Winning Balance author, who shares daughter Drew, 22, and son Jett, 2 months, with the former professional football player, 30, told Us that making time for her relationship was “really hard” as a new mom.</p><p>“We struggled with that with Drew,” the former gymnast explained. “Not in a dramatic way, of course, not calling it quits, but we really struggled with feeling disconnected from each other. I didn’t know who he was as a dad. He didn’t know who I was as a mom. It just changes who you are.”</p><p>The athletes had to “start the dating process over again,” and they were intentional about navigating this change when <a href=#>their baby boy arrived in July</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Shawn-Johnson-East-and-Andrew-East-Felt-Disconnected-After-Having-Kids-Our-Marriage-Struggled-3.jpg><p>“We’ve had our ups and down with, like, trying to figure it out again,” the Iowa native told Us. “But I feel like we’re going to get through it faster than we did [last time]. I think we already hit, like, the little slump and we’re going back up. … We’re having to schedule our little talks and our dinners, but we really appreciate any time we get with each other.”</p><p>The<a href=#> Dancing With the Stars </a>alum added that she and Andrew weren’t the only ones making a major adjustment when Jett arrived. Shawn told Us that they prepared Drew for her big sister role by trying not to “make too big of a deal” out of the change.</p><p>“She was in the baby doll phase when he arrived,” the<a href=#> Celebrity Apprentice</a> alum said. “She loved pushing baby dolls around and being a little mommy. So we tried to make it just another day, like, ‘This is your baby. We love you.’ We tried to keep everything normal with her. We [made] sure we didn’t take any time away from her. So if I was tending to my son, then Andrew would spend all his time with Drew and vice versa.”</p><p>Since Jett is a “chill baby” who “barely cries,” his big sister and parents have “nothing to complain about, Shawn joked.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Although he’s a “happy baby,” the <a href=#>Challenge: Champs vs. Stars</a> alum has relied on Philips Avent products to help ease her transition to two under 2. “They’re truly a lifeline in my household,” Shawn gushed. “We use all of their products. I can vouch for every single one of them. … All of their resources, all of their products make being a mom and being a parent so much easier. And they’re tried and true. You can’t get any better.”</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGasoJGsu262zqGlrKeeYq6vsNGermadkajBtHnMmqmroZGcsm6%2F06usoJ%2BcmrFurcWtnKtlmJbDqrrGZqKinKNk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
