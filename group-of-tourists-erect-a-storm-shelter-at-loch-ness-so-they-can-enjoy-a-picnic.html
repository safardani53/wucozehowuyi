Steve Feltham snapped the group huddled around a picnic table at Dores Beach on the banks of Loch Ness with a huge tent-like shelter to protect them from the elements.
The determined travellers were clearly not going to let anything stop them from eating outdoors and decided to sit under the huge orange sheet instead of venturing indoors for their lunch."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There's eight tourists under there enjoying a picnic in the Highland summer! Look at all the feet sticking out the bottom. Never seen that before.”</p><p>He later said: “Miscounted, there’s only five. I just walked over from my van and photographed them. They had no idea I was there.</p><p>“It’s a Vango air shelter. Dread to think how you keep it inflated though.”</p><p>Facebook users were quick to react and call out the visitors for being too “soft” to handle the Scottish summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000258456473.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/nintchdbpict000258456475.jpg><p>Laura Hulse said: “Surely just go in the pub if you're that soft?”</p><p>Scot Lowe agreed and wrote: “Haha! What a bunch of pussies! That stupid excuse for a shelter is overdoing it!”</p><p>And Sarah Denning joked: “Bet they are enjoying the view …”</p><p>But Zack Sackinger seemed impressed and asked: “Please, does anyone here have an idea where to buy this gadget? It’s genius.”</p><p>The tourists’ experience of a Highland summer comes as large parts of Scotland have been hit by a recent cold snap as strong winds wreaked havoc across the country.</p><p>Flash flooding has hit parts of Glasgow whilst shocking thunderstorms have caused damage to homes in the north of the country.</p><p>And an <a href=#>oil rig carrying 280 tons of diesel was blown ashore on the Isle of Lewis</a> earlier this week.</p><p>Brutal winds caused the the 17,000-ton semi-submersible Transocean Winner rig to run aground on Monday.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
