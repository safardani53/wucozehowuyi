Likewise, Laura is an American citizen with a white caucasian ethnic background.

Growing up, Cover was a tomboy and often played sports like most boys in her school.</p><p>Laura was selected for the school’s football team during high school. Also, she did gymnastics while she was a teenager.</p><h2>Laura Cover | Age And Body Measurements</h2><p>It is hard to believe that this blonde bombshell, who also worked as a Playboy model, grew up as a tomboy in her school days.</p><p>This gorgeous model was born in 1977, which makes her 46 years old in 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>Not to mention, the American model celebrates her birthday every year on the sixth of May. Her sun sign happens to be Taurus. The people of this sign are known to be resilient, hard-working, and loyal at the most.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/asdfb.png><p>Laura has a pleasant personality and is a delight to work with. However, her personality is not the only thing attractive about her.</p><p>The former model knows how to maintain her appearance and present herself in public. Standing at 1.65 m, Cover has maintained her weight to 117 lbs.</p><p>Moreover, her blonde hair and stunning pair of blue eyes add more to her beauty.</p><h2>Meet Aaron Boone’s Wife | Laura Cover</h2><p>As mentioned above, Laura is a former model and <a href=# rel=noopener>actress</a> who posed for Playboy magazine. But most of her recognition comes from her relationship with Aaron Boone, the former baseball player.</p><p>It is unclear when and how Cover and Boone met or how long they dated. But indeed, they have known each other for a long time. The two tied the knot on November 9, 2002.</p><p>Just like their dating life, the couple’s wedding was held in the presence of close friends and family. Aaron and Laura now live a comfortable life in each other’s company.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/636536862768328704-EPA-USA-BASEBALL-MLB-95838355-scaled.webp><p>The couple has four adorable children. Laura gave birth to their daughter, Bella, and son, Brandon, while Jeanel and Sergot were adopted later.</p><p>Likewise, Boone talks fondly about his children and wife. During a 2014 interview with LifeOfDad.com, Boone expressed how watching his son play sports like football and baseball was enjoyable.</p><p>“I try to impart things that I know without being overwhelming. I really hope that he has as much fun as he can in what he is doing, Even when you play at the Major League level, you are playing it as eight years old.”</p><p>Also, Aaron did not forget to talk about his family. He said, “In the wintertime right now if it snows all weekend, it is awesome just to go up there and see it snow, sled, and mess around with the kids.”</p><p>We can see how much Aaron cherishes his family and takes care of them from the blog.</p><p>“It is also fun to go up there in the summertime to go swimming and play golf. Just being in a mountain community is something my family has enjoyed.”</p><p>The family of six now lives in Greenwich, Connecticut. Aaron revealed that his family owns a cabin in Northern Arizona, where they mostly spend their winter days.&nbsp;</p><h3>Laura Cover Was Pregnant With Second Child When Boone Had Open-Heart Surgery</h3><p>Just when everything seemed happy and going its way, Boone was stuck with a heart condition that jeopardized his career.</p><p>In 2008, while he was a member of the Houston Astros, Aaron needed to have open-heart surgery to replace a bicuspid aortic valve.</p><p>Even though Boone had suffered from the condition since his college days, the recent tests showed it was only getting worse.</p><p>Aaron said in an interview with The New York Times, “I’ve monitored it all these years. I knew this day was out there. I just didn’t know it was now.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/vbkl.png><p>Luckily, Aaron recovered from the surgery, and doctors even told him he could return as a baseball player.</p><p>However, the reality was far scarier for his family, especially his wife, Cover, who was pregnant then.</p><p>Boone had the operation at Standford University Hospital in California, and it was a success. He returned to the field within five months, on August 10, 2009.</p><p>But no matter what, the family doesn’t want to experience those moments again.</p><h2>Laura Cover | Playboy Model</h2><p>Growing up as a tomboy and entering the modeling world, and featuring in Playboy magazine is not something that you see every often.</p><p>It all started when she auditioned at an open call at a Playboy studio.</p><p>Laura did gymnastics, played soccer during high school, and was built well. Being attractive with a toned physique was a plus point for her.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about her first playboy experience, she said, “I just walked into the studio, which I’m told is unusual. I don’t have modeling experience. I didn’t have any nude stuff, and I didn’t want to get some from Joe Photographer. So I went to the Playboy studio by myself one day. They have an open call, and you have a Polaroid taken.”</p><p>Cover said it was only after high school that she became more feminine and even vowed to stay true to her side after the change.</p><p>Shortly after, Laura was selected as the Playmate of the Month in the magazine’s October 1998 issue.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/laura-002.jpg><p>Described as “buxom, curvy, and sexy well-built blonde” on Playboy’s website, Laura’s centerfold was photographed by Arny Freytag. Other than that, she appeared in numerous magazines and did many photoshoots.</p><h3>Appearances In Game Show And TV Series&nbsp;</h3><p>In 2001, Cover appeared on the “Playmate Edition” of the TV game show titled Weakest Link. She was also on the game show with other Playboy bunnies who competed for money to give to charity.</p><p>Some other models who participated in the shows were Shanna Moakler, Julie McCullough, Renee Tenison, Jennifer Walcott, and many others.</p><p>The show focused on asking trivia questions while insults were hurled at them by British host Anne Robinson. Then the group voted out the weakest link until only one person remained.</p><p>Laura was never afraid of trying something new and even went for Talking Blue and Mystique Magazine. In the beginning, she dealt with a lot of backlashes but eventually her fans embraced it with both hands.</p><p>The former Playboy model also appeared in various TV series like Howard Stern’s Weakest Link, The Howard Stern Radio Show, and many more.&nbsp;</p><p>Cover is currently retired from modeling and is more into her family and raising kids. She often appears to watch MLB games with her husband, Aaron Boone.&nbsp;</p><h3>Laura Cover’s Charity Work</h3><p>After being a model and actress, one of the things she vowed was to stay true to herself. Among many things, it included helping the community in any way she could.</p><p>She is involved with various charities, including a breast cancer foundation. Not to mention, Laura is specially focused on helping children from third-world countries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/22140781_10211433685012229_4814919486954337848_n.webp><p>When asked about her charity, she said, “I’ve had a Christian Children’s Fund Child, Bernabe, for two years. He is from Guatemala. He’s three, not old enough to write- sometimes I get letters that his sister writes. It’s my way of contributing.”</p><p>To this date, Laura continues working with various charity organizations.</p><h2>Laura Cover | Net Worth And Income</h2><p>The beautiful and hot model, Laura Cover, worked for the modeling industry for over 20 years.
