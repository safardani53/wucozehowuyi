But with encouragement from friends and family, she entered her local Miss Conway County pageant — and won. That gave her the confidence to enter the statewide Arkansas Mrs. Fair Queen Pageant, where she placed second overall.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It took a lot of courage to get up there on that stage, because everyone there was very small,” Gilmore said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I overheard [another contestant] talking to another girl, ‘A chubby girl beat me!’ and I was like, ‘Shine like a superstar.’ That’s what I said! And I walked away,” Gilmore added, laughing. “In a sense, what she said was true. But I was like you know what? I’m beautiful just like everyone else. Everyone deserves a chance and I won fair and square.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5iarq3Ax2inmp%2BVlru1ecyopJ6mpKh6qrrSqaCroZ6cenN8kG9m</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
