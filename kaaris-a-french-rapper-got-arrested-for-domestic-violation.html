Prosecutors said he struck his former partner.&nbsp;Olivier was called and turned himself up at Saint-Genevieve-des-Bois. Accuser Linda P.’s attorney, Adrien Gabeaud, said that he, along with Linda, would be questioned later for legal reasons. Linda is Olivier’s ex, and the two had a kid together. Linda filed a complaint against the artist in July of this year, and Olivier also complained, claiming that the story was incorrect.</p><p>Adrien claims that his client has been the victim of domestic abuse since last year, while Olivier’s lawyer, Yassine Maharsi, claims that his client is innocent. Linda said that Olivier grew furious when he began behaving distantly, which disturbed their child.&nbsp;Linda discovered that Olivier had relocated, and when she went to find him, he kicked and struck her. During the claimed confrontation, he apparently broke her fingernails.</p><p>Linda was forced to use crutches and wear a splint on her leg for two weeks. She even mentioned a lady who was with Kaaris but refused to assist her. Meanwhile, Olivier refuted her accusations, claiming that she made the violent behavior up out of thin air. He said she tried to put him under public, financial, and legal pressure.</p><p></p><h2>Kaaris made his debut in the music industry in 2001.</h2><p>Kaaris, who was born on January 30, 1980, is a well-known rapper, record producer, composer, and actor. He is most known for his album Or Noir, which was published in October 2013 via Therapy Music / AZ / Universal Music.&nbsp;He was raised in Sevran, northeast of Paris. There is no information about his parents or educational background.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kaaris-1.jpg alt=Kaaris width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Olivier began rapping in 1999, and his first mixtape was published in 2001. He returned to Ivory Coast for a short period before returning to France due to political upheaval. Following the publication of his first street album, 43eme Bima, in 2007, he was signed to an indie label, French Cut Music. Kaaris then met French rapper Booba and had his first chance to collaborate with him on a song called Criminelle League. The duet appeared on Booba’s mixtape Autopsie Vol. 4, which was released in November 2011.</p><p>The 42-year-old then released a song called Kalash, which was well welcomed by critics and the public alike. He also appeared on Booba’s sixth studio album, Futur. Universal Music Group published the album, which included eight additional songs not included in the initial edition.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Kaaris-2.jpg alt=Kaaris width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Kaaris is well-known for co-writing his songs with the record production duo Therapy. He was subsequently entangled in legal difficulties and received an 18-month suspended sentence as well as a €50,000 fine. This occurred due to a disagreement with Booba in August 2018, which led to the temporary closure of Hall 1 at Paris-Orly Airport.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Kaaris</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Rapper</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiimpminsBurYyfqZ6mk516s63PqZyrZZekwW6t0aucrKyVmXqnu9Fmm6illajBqq%2BMr6CopJGptrC6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
