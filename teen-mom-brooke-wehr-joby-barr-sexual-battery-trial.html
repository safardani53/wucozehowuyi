Coach Barr explained to her that he would start the game and send her a photo, of which she would have to mimic his state of dress as well as pose and then return the photo.”</p><p>He sent a photo of himself with no pants on, though nothing “vulgar” was seen in the photo, according to the alleged victim.&nbsp;</p><p>She told the coach that the game and photo was “inappropriate” and they stopped messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>But the two allegedly began talking again in the Spring of 2021 when he was coaching track.&nbsp;</p><p>The incident report alleged: “The conversations led to the point that [the student] and Coach Barr began meeting and going to Coach Barr’s residence. Once at Coach Barr’s residence they proceeded to have consensual sex, this occurred on four separate occasions.”</p><p>According to the report, she came forward because she “now realized that he was grooming her into the sexual relationship and taking advantage of the situation.”</p><p>She also claimed there is “another possible victim.”</p><p>The Superintendent claimed Joby was not actively coaching at the school because of intermission between the teams he coached when the alleged sexual relationship occurred, though he was still on contract with the school as an employed coach.&nbsp;</p><h2>BEHIND BARS</h2><p>As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun previously reported</a>, court papers claimed Joby “did engage in sexual conduct” with his 18-year-old female student while he was a “teacher, administrator, coach or other person in authority employed by or serving in a school.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Joby was jailed until his arraignment, where he pleaded not guilty.&nbsp;</p><p>A clerk for the Belmont County Jail confirmed to The Sun that he posted $10,000 bond after the hearing.&nbsp;</p><p>Belmont County Prosecutor Kevin Flanagan told&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WTRF</a>: “It is a situation that Ohio law recognizes as a relationship that just can not exist, but it’s not an indictment against the entire school. It is just one individual.&nbsp;</p><p>“There is no other evidence in any way shape or form to indicate that anybody else had anything to do with this.”</p><p>He faces up to five years in prison per count.&nbsp;</p><h2>BROOKE'S PAIN</h2><p>The alleged relationship with the student occurred during his relationship with Brooke, as she posted her first photo with Joby in July 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>Brooke&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">announced her engagement to Joby</a>, 31, in August.&nbsp;</p><p>She captioned photos of her engagement ring: "Still in awe over this past weekend. I can’t wait to marry my best friend."</p><p>Their last photo together was on September 8.&nbsp;</p><p>Though it is unclear if they are still together, Brooke hasn’t deleted their photos from her Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><p>In November, she <a href=#>posted a cryptic quote that read</a>: "Accept what IS, let go of what WAS, and have faith in what WILL BE."</p><h2>JEREMY RELATIONSHIP</h2><p>Brooke dated Teen Mom 2 star Leah Messer’s ex-husband Jeremy.&nbsp;</p><p>Jeremy, 32, and Brooke began dating in May of 2015, six months after he filed for divorce from&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Leah</a>, who he shares daughter Adalynn, 8, with.</p><p>Two years later, they broke up for the first time, starting an on-and-off relationship.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>They would reunite shortly after, but parted ways just one month later when Brooke accused Jeremy of cheating on her with multiple women, including her best friend.</p><p>The father of one eventually admitted that he did sleep with Brooke's friend, but claimed he only did so after she "slept with some other guy first.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000670671469-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000704972552.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/01/NINTCHDBPICT000638177107.jpg><p><strong>If you or someone you know is affected by any of the issues raised in this story, call RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network) at 800-656-HOPE (4673).</strong></p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The US Sun team?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hsZGqEdIKVaKuenZ5iurC5jJupqKebmnq4scerZKOnkq56o63Rq2Ssnaiqrq15wZqrrZ2irnq1vsiao2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
