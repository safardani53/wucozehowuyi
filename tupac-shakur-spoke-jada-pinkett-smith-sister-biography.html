And nothing else could be talked about but Jada,” Sekyiwa said in the book via <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE</a>. “His music changed. This people changed. And Jada came — the entity! The magazine posters had come off his wall and John’s art went up on his wall. And pictures of Jada.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tupac-shakur-jada-pinkett-smith-sister-book-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Tupac and Jada, 52, first met at their Maryland high school, Baltimore School for the Arts, when they were chasing their creative careers, and she became “a lifelong friend.” Staci also reportedly mentioned a song that Tupac wrote to the actress after he moved to Marin City, CA. It was apparently called “The omega of my Heart” and featured details about how much he admired her.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“u will never fully understand / How Deeply my Heart Feels 4 u,” some of the words in the poem includes, according to the new book. “U R my Heart in Human Form / a Friend I could never replace,” it then concludes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/tupac-shakur-jada-pinkett-smith-sister-book-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>This isn’t the first time the public has heard about Tupac and Jada’s friendship. The <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Girls Trip star</a> has also gushed over the talented artist and how much they cared for each other, in several interviews. She called their bond a “soulmate friendship,” in an interview with <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Out</a> earlier this month.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“If there is such a thing as past lives, I definitely think that Pac and I have traveled a few together,” she said when asked if she ever regretted that their friendship didn’t turn to romance. “It just wasn’t possible.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It was like God made us that way,” she continued. “It was like, look, I’m going to put y’all together, right? Y’all are going to be a dynamic duo. But I’m going to tell you right now, I’m going to make it so y’all are not going to be able to get together ’cause that just wasn’t the purpose.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tupac and Jada weren’t on speaking terms when he was murdered at the age of 25 in 1997. She previously revealed she distanced herself after she thought his life was becoming too dangerous.
