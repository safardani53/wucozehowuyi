In 2022, we can all likely relate. 
Anyways, it appears as though his real-life brother, Dan Shalhoub, would have been a good friend to his reel-life character.  
Apart from making a living by professionally cleaning window blinds, Dan is an inventor who helped dog owners clean up after their dogs."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I'm not doing this for 15 years."</p><h2>How Shapoopie Came to Be</h2><p>While there might have been people who would have given up the dog at this point, Dan wasn't one of those people.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, he invented a device to make his life easier.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>The Shapoopie began as a golf ball retriever with a telescoping handle and a plastic bag rigged on one end of the stick.&nbsp;</p><p>With the telescoping stick, the wielder of the preliminary Shapoopie would place the plastic bag tactfully to catch the dog feces before it hit the ground.&nbsp;</p><p>After undergoing design and engineering, the device now features a basket that holds removable plastic liners with snap-shut lids. Fully extended, it looks like a little toilet on a stick.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>So, for the final product, the wielder would open the plastic liner, let the dog do its business in the little chamber, and seal it shut for later disposal.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Check out this video where Tony did a demonstration.&nbsp;</p><p>Apart from Dan, Tony has seven other siblings, namely&nbsp;Amy Shalhoub,&nbsp;Maggie Shalhoub,&nbsp;Michael Shalhoub,&nbsp;Susan Shalhoub Larkin,&nbsp;Jane Shalhoub,&nbsp;Sherry&nbsp;Matzdorff, Bill Shalhoub, and&nbsp; Deborah Shalhoub-Landin. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Much like Tony, his siblings Michael and Susan are also actors.
