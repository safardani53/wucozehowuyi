The artist reacted to a Rasmussen Report survey on whether “it’s OK to be white,” which found that 53% of African-Americans concurred with the statement. Adams, on the other hand, concentrated on those who disagreed and branded African-Americans a “hate group.”&nbsp;Before launching into his racial diatribe, he even told Caucasians to “get the heck away from Black people” and claimed it was the “first political survey” that “ever altered” his actions.</p><h2>Scott Adams’ ethnically insensitive remarks</h2><p>On Wednesday, February 22, pro-Trump artist Scott Adams discussed a Rasmussen Report survey in which 53 percent of African-Americans concurred that “it’s OK to be white” on his audio program. He quickly launched into an improper tirade, claiming that the survey shows there is “no mending” the country’s racial tensions and suggesting that Caucasians live in a mainly divided area.</p><p>In addition, the artist made a satirical comment about ethnic identification, saying:</p><p>“I’ve identified as Black for a long time because I like to be on the successful side. And I enjoy assisting others. I’ve always believed that if you assist the African society, you’ll be able to discover the most advantage.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Scott-Adams-1.jpg alt="Scott Adams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>He went on to say:</p><p>“However, it comes out that nearly half of that squad thinks it’s inappropriate for me to be Caucasian. That’s why I identified as Black for a while, so I could be on the victorious side.</p><p>In response to the survey findings, Scott Adams stated that he will “re-identify as European” because he does not “want to be a part of a racist organization.” The artist also claimed he “accidentally joined” the organization, making fun of his African-American heritage.</p><p>“If nearly half of all Negroes are against white people—according to this survey, not to me, according to this poll—a that’s hate organization.”</p><p>The 65-year-old also encouraged White watchers to distance themselves from African-Americans, saying:</p><p>“I would say, based on the present way things are moving, the greatest counsel I would offer to white people is to get the heck away from African people. Just get the f*** out of here. Just get away, wherever you have to go. Because there is no way to repair this. This is irreversible.”</p><p>Adams claimed that Caucasians needed to “leave,” and that he had already relocated to a “very low African population” region. The artist said there is a “correlation” between a “mostly Black community” and “a lot of issues he didn’t see” in white-dominated neighborhoods, citing African-American CNN anchor Don Lemon.</p><p>He then stated that Caucasians should not assist African-Americans because the work supposedly does not “pay off”:</p><p>“So I don’t believe it makes any sense as a white resident of America to attempt to assist African people anymore. It makes no logic. There is no logical desire left. So I’m going to take a step back from being useful to African America because it doesn’t appear to be paying off.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Scott-Adams.jpg alt="Scott Adams" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Adams went on to say that it isn’t even “worth trying”:</p><p>“The only result is I get labeled a bigot. That is the only possible result. If you’re Caucasian, it makes no logic to assist African Americans. It’s all over. “I don’t believe it’s even worth attempting.”</p><p>The artist stated again that Caucasians “just need to get away from them,” particularly those “who don’t want to concentrate on schooling.”&nbsp;He also stated that he is “really weary of seeing video after video of Black Americans beating up non-Black citizens,” and that he witnesses “some Black person pounding the sh*t out of some white person” every “d*mn” day.</p><h2>Netizens condemn Scott Adams for his Racist rant.</h2><p>Scott Adams fell into the midst of a major scandal after publicly participating in a racial rant and bashing African-Americans over a survey result during a YouTube video. His comments upset several social media users, and many went to Twitter to criticize the cartoonist:</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>So…. Scott Adams just said the quiet part out loud.<br>There’s a percentage who’s driven past the racist narrative I respect more than most. But something’s gotta change.<br>People calling him racist, but the video speaks for itself. I’m tired of the violence against white people <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rLW2NjjZtk</a></p><p>— Carolina Patriot (@ACarolinaGuy) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2023</a></p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Dilbert creator Scott Adams got cancelled for calling black people “a hate group” because a poll found half of them are not ok with white people.<br>Race grifters often call white people racist, but the evidence shows white people are least racist while black people are most racist. <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Jp3oqzY4Nw</a></p><p>— F0STRE 🇮🇱🇬🇧🇺🇸 (@F0STRE) <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="external noopener noreferrer">February 25, 2023</a></p><p>Following the event, Cleveland’s Plain Dealer newspaper declared that it will no longer work with Dilbert artist Scott Adams and stated that the choice to remove the comic from its pages was “not a tough one”:</p><p>“This is a choice founded on the values of this journalistic company and the community we serve. Racists have no place in our community. We definitely do not want to assist them financially.”</p><p>The Plain Dealer also mentioned that Adams’ remarks came during Black History Month and that readers might see some Dilbert comics in the “next week or so” because cartoon sections are often produced ahead of time.&nbsp;However, the publication may allegedly show a dark area where Dilbert used to be released until a substitute is found.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnKekqXqisMCmqmaho2Kzoq%2FIp55mmpGYuK2t0qFkmp6kmr9utMRmpJqclWKubr7AnKCsrF2nsq6t0aRm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
