He is my dream. He is an elusive man. He will just disappear for seven years. So trying to get him and pin him down...he is slippery.</p><p>“He has greased himself up and I chase him around the bedroom but he keeps getting away.</p><p>“If he is up for it, I would do it tomorrow.</p><p>“Niall would be one of course. We wrote a song and it was not good. Yeah, it was f***ing s**t. He wrote most of it.”</p><p>Lewis added of Niall’s ­former bandmate: “Obviously Harry Styles — I am a big fan. He is really like a successful singer. Probably the biggest in the world at the moment and he is f***king super-sexy.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Bizarre</h2></p><p>As for Lewis’ top tips for how to write a huge hit, the Before You Go singer says it’s all about who you know rather than talent.</p><p>Lewis said: “Get famous enough that <a href=#>Ed Sheeran</a> will write with you. Just do it every day.</p><p>“I am the laziest person I know. The fact I made it here today is a miracle. Just write s**t songs but one day they will be less s**t.”</p><p>Lewis’s cheeky jibes at his pal come just weeks after Heaven singer Niall accused him of <a href=#>fibbing in his hard- hitting How I’m Feeling Now Netflix documentary.</a></p><p>Appearing on Radio 2, Niall told Scott Mills that Lewis’s claim that he does his own washing was simply made up for the cameras.</p><p>Niall laughed: “He doesn’t do his own washing. I spoke to his mother the other night. He’s a liar!</p><p>“He maybe did it for the ­cameras...I swear to God. I said to his mother, ‘Are you in his flat often?’ She goes, ‘Yeah, when he hands me the washing. He probably has to do his own smalls as I wouldn’t hand his smalls to anyone else... smalls that not even a mother would love.”</p><p>Last week saw Lewis finally drop his second album after 2019’s Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent.</p><p>The record has already given him three No1 singles with Pointless, Wish You The Best and Forget Me, so I reckon he’s a shoo-in to hit the top spot again.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/editorial-use-harry-styles-performs-819355898.jpg><h2 class=has-text-align-center>That's Wrexcellent</h2><p><a href=#>WREXHAM FC’s</a> popularity has gone through the roof thanks to <a href=#>Ryan Reynolds.</a></p><p>And now they’ve caught the eye of Kings Of Leon, who will play two huge concerts at their Racecourse Ground on May 27 and 28.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/musical-guest-kings-leon-performs-819323416.jpg><p>The latter show will <a href=#>celebrate the team’s promotion to the Football League,</a> with insiders revealing Wrexham forward <a href=#>Paul Mullin</a> is keen to get up on stage.</p><p>Drummer Nathan Followill said of the gigs: “We are counting down the days until our big Wrexham shows, and the promotion party on May 28 will be one for the ages.”</p><p>Ryan and his Wrexham co-owner <a href=#>Rob McElhenney</a> flew the squad to <a href=#>Las Vegas for a massive party after they were promoted</a>, and the team were filmed celebrating in front of a Kings Of Leon-themed fountain show outside the Bellagio hotel.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Perrie's Little Pix</h2><p>IT’S been a year since she last graced the stage with Little Mix for their final show.</p><p>But <a href=#>Perrie Edwards</a> proved she isn’t camera shy as she posed for a selfie at <a href=#>Liverpool’s</a> ground <a href=#>Anfield</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/perrie-edwards-partner-liverpools-alex-819066929.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/97795073-e14d-4dd5-9401-b770bf144094.jpg><p>Dressed down in a cream cardigan and shades, Perrie joined her footballer fiancé <a href=#>Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain</a> for his last ever match with the Reds over the weekend.</p><p>Keen to make the game a family affair, the Sweet Melody singer cheered on her man alongside their son Axel as his team drew 1-1 against <a href=#>Aston Villa.</a></p><p>The couple are currently planning their wedding after the midfielder popped the question last summer.</p><p>Perrie, who is deep into recording her debut solo album, recently said: “Where do you even start with a wedding?
