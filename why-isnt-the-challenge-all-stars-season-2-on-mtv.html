So, why isn't <a href=#>The Challenge: All-Stars</a> Season 2 on MTV?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Apparently, MTV has so much Challenge-related content that it had to turn to the Viacom-owned streaming platform Paramount Plus to pick up some of the slack. Viacom also owns MTV, so the network and the streaming platform fall under the same conglomerate.</p><p>But some Challenge fans are a little confused about why producers didn't just wait to air All-Stars Season 2 on MTV.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why isn't 'The Challenge: All-Stars' Season 2 on MTV?</h2><p>Even though The Challenge: All-Stars is just as important as other seasons, it's considered a "special" season. Spring Break Challenge and The Challenge: Champs vs. Stars were also labeled special seasons because they're a little different from the standard format.</p><p>The Challenge specials do feature top-performing players from the franchise and they include difficult competitions and a monetary prize.</p><p>But they often have fewer episodes than standard seasons. And they have themes that set them apart from other seasons. All-Stars in particular features players who are considered the best of the best from recent seasons and from years ago. Because The Challenge: All-Stars Season 2 isn't a *regular* season, it makes more sense to run it on Paramount Plus.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>While All-Stars airs on the streaming service, The Challenge: Spies, Lies & Allies is on MTV. This could be another reason why All-Stars isn't on the network. Both shows run concurrently.</p><p>And <a href=#>Spies, Lies & Allies</a> is actually the official Season 37 of The Challenge. Instead of producers struggling to find a way to fit both versions of The Challenge into one calendar year, it seems they turned to Paramount Plus.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The 'All-Stars' Season 2 prize isn't as big as some other seasons.</h2><p>The Challenge: All-Stars Season 2 features iconic players like Casey Cooper, Derrick Kosinski, and Darrell Taylor. But since it's a special season, the prize amount is smaller. The Challenge usually offers $1 million to the winner.</p><p>The All-Stars <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 2 prize</a> is $500,000. Okay, it's still not a bad prize at the end of a grueling competition. But it's significantly less than what the winner of Spies, Lies & Allies walks away with.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tina is gonna be on season 2 of the challenge all stars, I'm shook!

Although they're called all-stars, many weren't invited back for more seasons of The Challenge until now.</p><p>Tyler Duckworth, who hadn't been on MTV in 10 years when they approached him about The Challenge, admitted to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Entertainment Weekly</a> that he was shocked.</p><p>"I was just as surprised as maybe you were when I got the phone call," he said. "I thought they had maybe lost my number. I was like, 'Wait, come again? Who is this?'"</p><p>Luckily, there were no hard feelings. And, because the other all-star players are in the same boat, they'll all be able to bond over their mutual returns to the franchise.</p><p>Watch The Challenge: All-Stars Season 2 on Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecispa1lpJ2ybq%2FHmqOlnZ6csm6ty6VkrKyRp8Buv8SaqqimXWd6sLqMpquv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
