The two initially met at St. Ninian’s School. They met as students, and their love story has lasted and will continue for decades. Andrew Robertson’s celebrity hasn’t changed him; he’s still the same modest man he used to be.

He was given the name Rocco. The couple just had their second child, this time a girl. Aria was her given name. Here’s a photo of Daddy and his kid. Rocco is dressed in a red home Liverpool shirt and has aspirations of becoming a player in the future. The left-footed pacy left-back must teach his kid to be a superstar like him, and we will adore seeing him in a professional Reds shirt one day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Rachel-Roberts-2.jpg><h2>How well do they know one another?</h2><p>Trent Alexander Arnold and Rachel Robertson’s husband Andrew Robertson discuss the Premier League and how well they know one other.
