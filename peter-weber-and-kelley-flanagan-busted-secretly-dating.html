Who does, really?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Are we dating? No," Peter has previously claimed.</p><p>"Do I love spending time with her?" he followed up at the time. "Absolutely."</p><p>“Could I see that in the future? Yeah, of course," Peter acknowledged.</p><p>He added: "I’d be extremely lucky and very happy if that happened."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2020/04/peter-weber-in-a-promo-pic-762x1024.png><p>"Of anyone, I’m the last person that needs to rush into any kind of relationship." Peter expresed at the time.</p><p>He sounded surprisingly wise in that moment.</p><p>Perhaps he was being honest … or maybe it was just a trick, saying the right things to throw fans off of the scent.</p><p>"I just had an engagement that didn’t work out," he pointed out.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/cs_srgb><p>"I just was trying to pursue things with another woman that didn’t work out," Peter reasoned.</p><p>"That’s why right now," he stressed, "I’m just taking it really, really slow."</p><p>Well, taking things slow means different things to different people.</p><p>Peter is young, horny, and more or less cooped up with Kelley.

The opposite is also true, of course.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Madison has previously shaded Peter for his infamous indecisiveness, leading up to just days before he began sheltering with Kelley.</p><p>"He was, like, calling me and texting me being like, ‘I miss you, let’s get back together,’" Madison accused last week.</p><p>"He had texted me two days before [he was with Kelley],” she revealed in her remote podcast interview.</p><p>That is something that The Bachelor viewers have an easy time believing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>“You were telling me how much you loved me and wanted to get back together," Madison accused, directing her ire at her ex.</p><p>"And now," she lamented, "you’re with the one person that was my best friend."</p><p>Madison expressed: "It just feels a little hurtful."</p><p>But is that the whole story?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Peter clapped back at Madison, expressing that there is "more to the story."</p><p>He did not, however, reveal what exactly that may be.</p><p>These days, Peter has nothing but time (and Kelley) on his hands.</p><p>Maybe he will choose to respond to reports about his relationship.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Peter Weber: My Jaw Dropped When I Saw Kelley Again!
