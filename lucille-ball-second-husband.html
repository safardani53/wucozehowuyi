The following year, she met and married Gary Morton, a comedian who had done the circuits at various summer resorts in the Catskills. He was also 13 years younger than Lucille, but the pair hit it off and they were married for more than 20 years.</p><p>After getting together, Lucille hired Gary at her production company, where he became a producer on various TV shows and even acted in some of them. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a letter Lucille reportedly wrote</u></a> to a friend of her relationship with Gary, he was just what she needed after a failed marriage that fizzled out more than once.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"Boy, did I pick a winner!" she wrote. "After 19 years with that Latin lover I never expected to marry again, but I'm glad I did!"</p><p>Lucille added in the letter, "When that first evening ended and Gary took me home, I felt more like myself than I had in months. I realized Gary had the natural humor of someone who loves to laugh and wants everyone to laugh with him. That made two of us."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gary Morton married a professional golfer after Lucille Ball died.</h2><p>When Lucille died, she left her estate to her two adult children and Gary. And in 1996, seven years after her death, Gary married professional golfer Susie McAllister. When Gary died in 1999, just a few years after their wedding, he left the remainder of Lucille's belongings to Susie.</p><p>She, in turn, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>auctioned off</u></a> artwork, personal letters between Lucille and Gary, and even a car of Lucille's years later. Susie explained in the auction that she had kept the items out of respect for both Gary and Lucille, but was ready to part with them more than 10 years after Gary's death.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Did Lucille Ball have kids with her second husband?</h2><p>Lucille was 50 years old when she and Gary got together. He was certainly younger, but they never had any children together. However, Lucille had two children with Desi: Lucie Arnaz and Desi Arnaz Jr.</p><p>They both followed in their parents' footsteps of working in the entertainment business in film producing and performing. And with grandchildren who did the same, it's safe to say that Lucille's legacy has been kept alive and well.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfocKktculnGaakaG5br%2FEnKannF2dwrSuwKeb</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
