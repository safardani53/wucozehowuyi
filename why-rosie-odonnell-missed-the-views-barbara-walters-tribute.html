Mourning in private. Rosie O’Donnell confirmed that she was invited to The View‘s Barbara Walters tribute — and explained why she preferred to grieve at home.
“They invited me, but I wasn’t able to make it,” the comedian, 60, explained in a TikTok video on Tuesday, January 3. “I didn’t want to be in a big group of people. And I don’t know, I was worried I would get upset and didn’t want to do that, so there you go."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

However, the former cohost had prior commitments. “She is on a plane and couldn’t change her schedule,” her representative explained.</p><p>Walters, who created The View and was on the roundtable until 2014, died on <a href=#>Friday, December 30</a>. She was 93.</p><p>“Barbara Walters passed away peacefully in her home surrounded by loved ones,” <strong>Cindi Berger</strong>, the TV presenter’s publicist, told Us Weekly in a statement at the time. “She lived her life with no regrets.

Although 93, man, who wouldn’t take that? What a long and eventful, legendary life she had,” the former Rosie O’Donnell Show host said via <a href=#>Instagram</a> at the time. “<a href=#>Spoke to every prominent world leader</a> in memory, interviewed everyone who’s anyone, and I was lucky enough to be in her orbit for a good many years.”</p><p>She continued, recalling memories of going to the theater with her former colleague. “We saw a lot of Broadway shows together, and whenever we’d go backstage, I’d try to help her over the steps backstage — and she would always smack my hand and tell me to leave her alone. She [knew] what she was doing I could tell you that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The New York native concluded: “May she rest in peace, and may everyone remember just what barriers she broke down for women. She was the first and will always be remembered.”</p><p>O’Donnell was on The View during the 2006-2007 season, replacing Vieira, 69. She asked to be released from her contract early, leaving the show after just eight months.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawoKliv7C%2FyJ5kqJyfo7umuMtmpKKro5qxbsDHnmSvoZWswG6uwKuZmqqRYsSiuNOeqaxlpKe2o8HTnmY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
