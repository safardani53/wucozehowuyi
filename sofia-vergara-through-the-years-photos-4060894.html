But the stunning&nbsp;Modern Family<strong>&nbsp;</strong>alum, 47, has worked hard to achieve incredible acclaim, award nominations, and a thriving personal life! Before she was Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, Sofia was tackling smaller roles in film and TV! Between 1995-2008, Sofia, who originally hails from Colombia, appeared in projects like&nbsp;Acapulco, cuerpo y alma, Four Brothers, and&nbsp;Dirty Sexy Money. With such a staggering filmography, it was only a matter of time before a creative team tapped into Sofia’s comedic prowess.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Finally, in 2009, Sofia earned her big break with the ABC comedy&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Modern Family</a>. For 11 seasons — over 250 episodes — Sofia played Gloria Delgado-Pritchett, the fast-talking Colombian wife of Jay (<strong>Ed O’Neill</strong>) and mother to Manny (<strong>Rico Rodriguez</strong>) and later Joe. For her work, Sofia earned four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series as well as four Golden Globe nominations for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role in a Series, Miniseries or Motion Picture Made for Television between 2010-2014.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>As a result of her incredible popularity in&nbsp;Modern Family, Sofia earned a slew of major roles in films like New Year’s Eve (2011), Hot Pursuit&nbsp;(2015) alongside&nbsp;<strong>Reese Witherspoon</strong>, and 2017’s The Emoji Movie.&nbsp;But it wasn’t just Sofia’s professional life that was thriving. The actress started dating&nbsp;True Blood and&nbsp;Magic Mike star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Joe Manganiello</strong></a> in 2014. After only six months of dating, the couple became engaged on Christmas Day that same year and went on to marry in a lovely ceremony in Palm Beach, FL in November 2015. Prior to her marriage to Joe, Sofia was married to her high school sweetheart <strong>Joe Gonzalez</strong> from 1991-1993. The couple have a son, <strong>Manolo</strong>, born in Sept. 1992.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/sofia-vergara-through-the-years-embed.jpg>As for her upcoming projects, Sofia is setting her sights on reality competition TV and is joining America’s Got Talent <a href=#>as a judge</a> for the series’ 15th season!
