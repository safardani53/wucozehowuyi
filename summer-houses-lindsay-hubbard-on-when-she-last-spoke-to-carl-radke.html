(Hubbard tells Us that the series had wrapped production when <a href=#>Radke contacted producers to capture the breakup</a>.) .</p><p>“It was a quick in and out conversation. But that was it,” she adds of their first conversation after he ended things. “And other than that, right now the only time we speak is through text and it’s when he needs to come to the apartment or when I’m traveling.”</p><p>Summer House fans have followed Radke and Hubbard on their journey since the show premiered in 2017. They <a href=#>briefly dated during season 4</a> before deciding they were better as friends. After deciding to <a href=#>give things a real shot at the end of season 6</a>, Radke proposed during season 7.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Summer-House-s-Lindsay-Hubbard-Claims-Carl-Radke-Had-No-Empathy-During-Sit-Down-After-Their-Split-691.jpg><p>Hubbard tells Us that she now has <a href=#>no plans to continue filming with Radke</a> after he ended things on screen.</p><p>“At this point in time, I would not be comfortable sharing a house with him after what he did. I mean, this man — I can never trust him again,” she explains. “The way that he called the producers and set up the cameras — [he] blindsided me and humiliated me in such a public way. I’m not comfortable at this point in time.”</p><p>Since the split, Hubbard has been focusing on herself and her friendships — and <a href=#>has no interest in reconciling with Radke.</a></p><p>“The door is one thousand percent closed in a romantic way. And, for now, in a friendship way [too],” she notes. “Maybe in 10 years I’ll consider being an acquaintance. But no, it’s closed on him completely for me.”</p><p>Hubbard remained largely silent in the initial weeks after her engagement ended, but she tells Us that she’s ready to tell her side of the story. “I wanna have this weight off my shoulders,” she says. “It really is to me that last little part of the healing process so I can free myself and really move on.”</p><p>Radke, for his part, <a href=#>addressed their split in a letter to wedding guests</a> days after calling off the wedding.</p><p>“Words cannot possibly express how difficult the last two weeks have been for Lindsay and I,” he wrote in a September letter to attendees. “We are so incredibly sorry to all of our guests for the confusion and lack of communication. We were left trying to figure out how this all exactly happened before we could even have the opportunity to determine the path forward amongst ourselves.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>He continued: “There have been a lot of false narratives and misunderstandings that have made this all the more painful but sadly at this time we are not moving forward with the wedding. The fact of the matter is Lindsay is devastated and I’m crushed with how all this transpired. I graciously ask for some patience and grace to heal and recover while we navigate this extremely difficult time.”</p><p>For more from Hubbard’s candid conversation, watch the video above and <a href=#>pick up the new issue of Us Weekly</a>, on stands Wednesday.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrZ2isrN5x6isrJ2jYrmqusOsmLJlmKqvo63RnWSopl2staa6jKyfnmWclsC1edKppqSdXam8bq%2FAq6NmqpGZuKZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
