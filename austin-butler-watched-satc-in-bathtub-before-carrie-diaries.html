The CW sitcom, which aired two seasons before its 2014 cancellation, followed Robb’s Carrie Bradshaw as she balanced high school in Castlebury, Connecticut, with a new internship in Manhattan. Butler portrayed Sebastian, who was Carrie’s <a href=#>high school crush and on-and-off boyfriend</a>.</p><p class=p1><i>The Carrie Diaries&nbsp;</i>was inspired by <a href=#><strong>Candace Bushnell</strong></a>’s Young Adult novel of the same name, which was <a href=#>a prequel spinoff following a younger version</a> of&nbsp;<i>Sex and the City</i>’s Carrie Bradshaw (<a href=#><strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong></a>) before she met her Manhattan besties Samantha Jones (<a href=#><strong>Kim Cattrall</strong></a>), Charlotte York (<a href=#><strong>Kristin Davis</strong></a>) and Miranda Hobbes (<a href=#><strong>Cynthia Nixon</strong></a>).</p><p class=p1>“I realized it was actually a really strong story,” Robb — who<a href=#> married <strong>Trevor Paul</strong> in September 2022</a> — <a href=#>previously gushed to&nbsp;<i>Teen Vogue&nbsp;</i>in February 2013</a> of the show’s premise. “It had a lot of heart and integrity, and Carrie seems like a character that I can grow with.”</p><p class=p1>Since&nbsp;<i>The Carrie Diaries</i>’ early cancellation, Butler has gone on to <a href=#>reach new career milestones</a>. His performance as<a href=#> Elvis Presley</a> in <a href=#><strong>Baz Luhrmann</strong>’s 2022 biopic</a> earned him <a href=#>his first Oscar nomination</a>.</p><p class=p1>“I’m so proud of him. I am just so thrilled for him,” the&nbsp;<i>Soul Surfer&nbsp;</i>actress <a href=#>exclusively&nbsp;told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in August 2022</a> of Butler. “He’s such a dedicated, focused actor&nbsp;and a kind person. So [he deserves] all the accolades.”</p><p class=p1>She continued at the time: “You know, when we met during&nbsp;<i>The Carrie Diaries</i>,&nbsp;everybody <a href=#>knew he was going to be a movie star</a>. You don’t have a face like that and not be a movie star. But he also, he has the intelligence and the dedication and the kindness to really [shine]. … He’s perfect for [the role of Elvis], but&nbsp;he’s perfect not just because he looks [like him], he embodied him. I mean&nbsp;he<a href=#> spent two years of his life studying the man</a>&nbsp;and getting into his bones.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>While both Robb and the&nbsp;<i>Shannara Chronicles&nbsp;</i>alum have moved on from their days at Castlebury High, Butler remains open about potentially revisiting Sebastian on&nbsp;<i>SATC</i>’s spinoff,&nbsp;<a href=#><i>And Just Like That</i></a>. (<i>AJLT&nbsp;</i>premiered in December 2021, starring Carrie, Charlotte and Miranda two decades later.)</p><p class=p1>“That’s a good idea. I hadn’t thought about it, but <a href=#>it’s a good idea</a>,” Butler quipped on Friday after host <strong>Clayton Davis</strong> noted that he played Elvis at various ages in&nbsp;<i>Elvis</i>. “Sebastian Kydd at 42 years old?”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJiuq6Seu26u1K2jnqpdrK61r8eem2arkamwbrXNZpmarJipwqN5wZ6dqKqVYrCivtGinGacmZa%2FqrHSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
