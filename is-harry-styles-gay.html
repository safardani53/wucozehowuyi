He has, however, been linked to many well-known women throughout his career, including Kiko Mizuhara, Camille Rowe, Tess Ward, Pandora Lennard, Kendall Jenner, <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, Erin Foster, and more.</p><p>Harry is currently dating Canadian actor Taylor Russell and the two appear to be going strong.</p><p>In an April 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Better Homes & Gardens</a>, Harry briefly touched on the subject of his sexuality.</p><p>"I've been really open with it with my friends, but that's my personal experience; it's mine," he told the publication. "The whole point of where we should be heading, which is toward accepting everybody and being more open, is that it doesn't matter, and it's about not having to label everything, not having to clarify what boxes you're checking."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>During a 2019 sit-down with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, the interviewer asked him if he's ever been asked if he's bisexual due to the perceptions that he doesn't define as straight based on his clothing choices, song lyrics, and more. "Um. I guess I haaaaave been asked? But, I dunno. Why?" he replied to the query.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"It’s not like I’m sitting on an answer, and protecting it, and holding it back. It’s not a case of: I’m not telling you cos I don’t want to tell you. It’s not: ooh this is mine and it’s not yours," he added.</p><p>"It’s: Who cares? Does that make sense? It’s just: Who cares?"</p><p>One of the projects that's been put into question is his song and music video "<a href=#>Watermelon Sugar</a>" due to the alleged meaning of the phrase. According to Urban Dictionary, "Watermelon Sugar" has to do with oral sex, which started quite the internet frenzy at the time of the song's release late last year. The top definition has since been updated to reflect Harry's song.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>In the music video "dedicated to touching," Harry is dressed in bright colors while dancing and eating watermelon with a bunch of women on a beach. In some takes, they are feeding and groping him. All that said, it's not much of a surprise that the ambiguity of this video was present and questioned by viewers.</p><p>But Harry swears that he doesn't use clothing and other tactics to impress fans. "Am I sprinkling in nuggets of sexual ambiguity to try and be more interesting? No," he admitted</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"In terms of how I wanna dress, and what the album sleeve’s gonna be, I tend to make decisions in terms of collaborators I want to work with. I want things to look a certain way. Not because it makes me look gay, or it makes me look straight, or it makes me look bisexual, but because I think it looks cool," Harry continued. "And more than that, I dunno, I just think sexuality’s something that’s fun. Honestly? I can’t say I’ve given it any more thought than that."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>In a 2022 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, he spoke about how much the public unfairly jumps to conclusions about his relationships. “Sometimes people say, ‘You’ve only publicly been with women,’ and I don’t think I’ve publicly been with anyone. If someone takes a picture of you with someone, it doesn’t mean you’re choosing to have a public relationship or something.”</p><p>Although Harry hasn't assigned a label to his sexual orientation, he has made it clear he's not entertaining the idea of giving the public what they want — an answer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButMCrqbJlo6nGrbHSZp6asQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
