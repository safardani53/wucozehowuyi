So many guys from the south are so hardcore, and they won’t open up like that. I felt very comfortable talking with him. He really intrigued me. So, he’s not normally the type I would go for, but there was definitely chemistry.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Of course, Mattie’s pal, Gus, was hesitant about her hooking up with his nemesis at first (the guys made up during the most recent episode). However, Mattie didn’t let this influence her decision to pursue Jeremiah. “I’m always up for opinions, but I’m also a grown a** woman,” she said. “I was open to hearing everyone out, but I’ve seen it all, so I just kind of do my own thing. I do take caution, though. Gus was like…this is how how he is and this is what he puts on, but let me tell you some stories. So I heard him out. I spoke with&nbsp;<strong>Aimee [Hall], Nilsa [Prowant]</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>Codi [Butts]</strong>. I kept that all in the back of my mind, but I also just wanted to be open to new things. I don’t really date or do anything like that because I don’t usually allow people in. So I’m like…I’m just going to let him in.”</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>🎶 Jeremiah, Mattie sitting in a tree!
