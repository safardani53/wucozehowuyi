General Mills responded.</p><p>Others on Twitter also longed for Oatmeal Crisp with Rasins' return.</p><p>"Oatmeal Crisp with Raisins was the best. Please bring it back," another fan tweeted.</p><p>General Mill's response was once again polite, but it did not indicate the cereal is coming back anytime soon.</p><p>"We'll let our team know you'd like for it to return!
