In Season 2 of Nancy Drew, viewers will see a host of new faces. Two characters that fans have already been introduced to are from Edward Stratemeyer’s literary world, The Bobbsey Twins. The Bobbsey Twins originated from a long-running novel series from 1904 about two sets of fraternal twins, Nan and Bert, and Flossie and Freddie, who solved mysteries together."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Like CW’s Nancy Drew updated the teen detective for a modern era, the Bobbsey Twins were also revised. The <a href=#>twin siblings</a> are played by Gil Bobbsey (Praneet Akilla) and Amanda Bobbsey (Aadila Dosani), and they solve petty crimes in order to survive.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who are Bobbsey Twins Gil and Amanda on ‘Nancy Drew’?</h2><p>Praneet hails from Calgary, Canada, and only began acting in 2013. The up and coming actor pursued his passion for acting after studying to become a chemical engineer, and it sure has paid off. He has appeared in projects like Jewel Fools, Lux-Me, and The Deadline. In 2018, Praneet was featured on the CW’s superhero series Arrow, and his breakthrough role came in 2020 with Netflix’s October Faction as Phillip Mishra.&nbsp;</p><p>In a recent interview with the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Calgary Herald</a>, Praneet talks about his familiarity with the Bobbsey Twins and finding out he landed a role on Nancy Drew. He says, “I wasn’t as familiar with them as I was Nancy Drew, but I certainly read a book or two here or there. I would play Nancy Drew video games on the old Windows 98 PCs, and they would factor into some of the games as well. So I was over the moon.”</p>Article continues below advertisement<figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Praneet Akilla (@p_akilla)</a></p></figure><p>Aadila, also from Calgary, has been performing since she was in diapers and also grew up playing sports. She played on the St. Michael's College Men's Rugby Team at the University of Toronto, and in 2006 was the only female member of the University of Toronto's championship rugby team. Aadila graduated with a degree but decided to pursue her acting. She has landed roles on shows like A Million Little Things, Unspeakable, and Beaver's Edge to name a few. &nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>She will also appear in the 2021 television movie Crossword Mysteries: Riddle Me Dead with Lacey Chabert.

Not only do the Bobbsey Twins drive the story in the premiere, but they also bring Nancy (Kennedy McMann) a clue that helps her fight the curse that’s following her and her friends. The Bobbsey Twins brings some fresh blood to Nancy’s already established crew as well as some much-needed street smarts that helps the teen detective break her curse and solve the town’s mysteries.&nbsp;</p><p>Gil also adds a potential romantic relationship for Nancy, with many fans speculating that after her break-up with Nick (Tunji Kasim) and her partner Owen's (Miles Gaston Villanueva) death, Nancy will end up turning to him. It will be interesting to see what kind of relationship forms between the two outside the rest of the gang, as well as the dynamics between the Bobbsey Twins and everyone else as Season 2 progresses.&nbsp;</p>Article continues below advertisement<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Nancy Drew airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on the CW.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfo66vr9hmm6udp2KvsK7BrJyyZaSstq%2B%2F</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
