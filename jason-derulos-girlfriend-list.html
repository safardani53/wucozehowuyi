"If you want something done, give it to a busy person," as the saying goes. That is, without a doubt, the Virgo anthem. Virgos approach life logically, practically, and methodically. Virgo is an earth sign that has historically been associated with the goddess of wheat and agriculture, a relationship that alludes to Virgo's profound roots in the tangible world. This earth sign is a perfectionist at heart who isn't scared to develop his or her talents through thorough and regular practice.</p><p>Born Jason Joel Desrouleaux, he became known for his double-Platinum hit, ‘Whatcha Say,’ which samples the Imogen Heap song ‘Hide and Seek.’ He has worked as a songwriter for artists like Birdman.
