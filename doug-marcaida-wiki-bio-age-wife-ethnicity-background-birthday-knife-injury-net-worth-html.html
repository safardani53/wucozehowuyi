He is the founder of Marcaida Kali, evolving martial art system in the Philippines. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-181 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Besides, he appears as a judge in History Channel’s series Forged in Fire, an original competition series which features epic weapon and blades on screen.</p><p>To help our readers get acquainted with the Forged in Fire star, we have here compiled a list of wikis on him. First, we look into his ethnicity, age, birthday, and background in knife handling. Later, we delved into his net worth and the relationship between him and his family members, especially his wife.</p><h2>Marcaida’s Wiki-Bio: Embraces Filipino Ethnicity</h2><p>Martial artist Marcaida, born in the Philippines, holds American nationality and is of Filipino descent. He <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">moved</a> from his birthplace&nbsp;Philippines to the USA with his mother and siblings. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-182 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Upon arriving in America, he and his family settled&nbsp;in the Hudson Avenue neighborhood in northeast Rochester.</p><p><strong>HISTORY CHANNEL'S VERY OWN:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Mike Wolfe On "Ultimate Joy" From Getting Married To Wife! Meet The Wolfe Family</a></strong></p><p>Moreover, the weapons combat expert is yet to reveal his birthday, age, and parents’ details. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-183 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But he once <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mentioned</a> his father in his Instagram post while sharing a picture of his father and his two sons.</p><p>“Dad...In the case of my sons Dj and Jaden, You are the grandfather! Lol...My dad in the middle at 16. My middle and youngest at 16,” Marcaida wrote in his caption.</p><h2>His Injury Prone Profession Credited for His Net Worth</h2><p>The artist serves as a judge in the History Channel’s original competition series Forged in Fire. Though he appears to be the most kind of all the judges, he is a dangerous man. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-184 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He deals with the most dangerous blades, which can even result in vicious injury. But Marcaida is conscious of the danger and teaches others about its consequences. He even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">mispronounces</a> the word ‘Kill’ as ‘Keal,’ and he believes it’s for a perfect reason. As per him, ‘Keal’ stands for ‘Keep Everyone Alive.’</p><p>Likewise, he is the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">founder</a> of Marcaida Kali, a heavily based martial art technique based on South East Asian styles. He also designs some of the world’s fatal blades and owns a knife shop called Marcaida Kali, where he sells his line of knives and other combat accessories.</p><p>Being a founder and owner, his net worth probably must be in the thousands. However, the exact details of net worth remain confined. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-185 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>He Didn't Always Know How To Forge</h2><p>According to Marcaida’s bio on History Channel, he <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">specializes</a> in hand-to-hand combat and battlefield strategy. One might add that the Forged in Fire judge is the walking encyclopedia in the evolution of weapons of war.</p><p>Despite being edged weapon combat specialists, neither he nor his fellow judge, Wil Wilis, knew how to forge until the third season of the show Forged in Fire. They were <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">taught</a> by J. Neilson, a fellow judge on the show.</p><p>History even released a clip chronicling the whole debacle. Marcaida can be seen appearing really frustrated with the task at hand throughout the duration of the whole clip. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-623 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He was quoted as saying: “This is why I pay people for this!”</p><h2>Marcaida Is Married and Has Kids</h2><p>Marcaida is a married man. But he prefers to keep the details of his married life very private, especially that of his wife.</p><p>That being said, he has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">disclosed</a> that he has three sons — the names of two of his sons are <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jaden</a> Christopher Marcaida and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Douglas</a> James Marcaida. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-187 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Moreover, he occasionally posts their pictures on social media. Doing that, in January 2018, Marcaida mentioned his children on his Instagram.</p><p></p><p><strong>'Forged in Fire' Judge Doug&nbsp;Marcaida mentions his children and father in his Instagram</strong> (Photo: Doug&nbsp;Marcaida's Instagram) <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-188 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He shared a picture of his father, and his younger and middle children declaring his father as a grandfather. He also cited in the comment that his boys are studying blades.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGicp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5m8trOMppirm5GesaJ51qKiomWSnrxurcaeZLChlpp6psDHp6CcoaSueqOtwqSeq6elo7Fursirq6Gcka56rLrIn5xmoZ6fwrPFjKecrWWnpL%2B1tI2hq6ak</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
