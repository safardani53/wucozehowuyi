Lord Aleem’s father, whose name and story are mostly unknown, is the driving force behind this booming organization.</p><p>Lord Aleem’s father, as the man behind the wheel of Platinum Executive Travel, plays a critical part in supporting his son’s expensive car-centric content.&nbsp;The unknown narrative of this wealthy patriarch and the roots of the family company raises exciting questions for Lord Aleem’s fans, who want to solve the mystery of the guy who supports the luxurious automobile culture that captivates viewers on digital platforms.</p><h2>Meet Lord Aleem, His Father Saleem Iqbal, and His Mother Ashifa Saleem: the Dynamic Duo Behind the Luxury Car Industry.</h2><p><strong>Saleem Iqbal</strong>, the father of social media influencer Lord Aleem, is a Pakistani-born entrepreneur who moved to the United Kingdom in the 1980s.&nbsp;Iqbal, a former taxi driver, saw a need for elite chauffeur services and launched Platinum Executive Travel in October 2006.&nbsp;This famous automobile rental firm has a portfolio that includes Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, Ferrari, and Bentley. Iqbal’s success as an entrepreneur goes beyond the automotive industry, as he owns many homes and companies in Birmingham and Solihull.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lord-Aleem-2.jpg alt="Lord Aleem" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Iqbal is married to Ashifa Saleem, who is also from Pakistan, and they have four children: Aleem, Anisa, Aisha, and Amaan.&nbsp;Aleem, the oldest son, actively aids his father in running the luxury automobile company while also establishing himself as a social media personality.&nbsp;Lord Aleem has become a renowned figure, exhibiting not just the family’s high-end automobiles but also providing an insight into their lifestyle, with a considerable following of over 1.2 million on Instagram and 455k followers on YouTube.&nbsp;The nickname “Lord Aleem” gives a personal touch to the influencer’s brand; it was given to him by his pals.</p><h2>Lord Aleem’s Ethnicity and Origin</h2><p><strong>Lord Aleem</strong> and his family are of Pakistani origin and come from a hamlet near Lahore. They have deep links to their ancestral house, where relatives are often present.&nbsp;The family embraces their fervent Muslim religion and follows Islamic teachings, which Lord Aleem often shares on his social media channels. Lord Aleem’s father, Saleem Iqbal, has experienced significant problems and controversy.</p><p>He was sentenced to two years in prison in 1996 for trying to pervert the course of justice in a heroin overdose case involving a 16-year-old girl. His role in convincing a witness to change a court statement resulted in his conviction. In 2013, Iqbal was charged with money laundering and received a 16-month suspended sentence and community service.&nbsp;His involvement in a network that laundered £180 million in narcotics money played a crucial role in this case.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Lord-Aleem-1.jpg alt="Lord Aleem" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite these obstacles, Saleem Iqbal has succeeded in developing a profitable enterprise that allows his family to live a luxury lifestyle.&nbsp;Despite the controversy, he is proud of his son’s achievements, notably Lord Aleem’s love of expensive automobiles.&nbsp;Iqbal is also a compassionate and philanthropic person, donating money and automobiles to many charities and organizations.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmedKao56dnWK2sq7ApWSappRirrS0yJ%2BYZquRobKmuYymnJ6sXaG8s7CMmqOenZ1ivaK%2BxKerrGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
