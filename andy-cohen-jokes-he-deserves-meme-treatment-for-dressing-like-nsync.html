Cohen accessorized his look with white sneakers.</p><p class=p1>Social media immediately dragged him for dressing down on the red carpet.</p><p class=p1>“You must be Andy Cohen wearing concords at jingle ball if you think we f—king,” one user wrote via X (Twitter) as another claimed that he “can’t dress.”</p><p class=p1>Others likened Cohen’s look to something that ‘NSync would have worn<a href=#> back in its heyday</a>. ‘NSync, which disbanded in 2004, launched the careers of <strong>Justin Timberlake</strong>, <strong>Lance Bass</strong>, <strong>Joey Fatone</strong>, <strong>Chris Kirkpatrick</strong> and <strong>JC Chasez</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Andy-Cohen-Jokes-He-Deserves-Meme-Treatment-for-His-Jingle-Ball-Outfit-Fans-Compare-to-Nsync-2.jpg><p class=p1>“Denim on denim was popular back then, don’t shoot me,” Fatone, 46, <a href=#>previously told </a><i><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> </i>in January 2019 of his boy band fads, before remembering that he loved the vest he wore in 1999. “That’s a handsome devil. That’s when I had my red hair and I loved Superman. Sleeveless vests were in!”</p><p class=p1>Cohen has never admitted if he has openly tried to dress like ‘NSync, but he is known for wearing tailored suits when on set of <i>Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen </i>or taping a Bravo reunion special. Working on Bravo has given him a new appreciation for fashion, especially seeing how far the stars go to look their best.</p><p class=p1>“In the early of Orange County, the fashion was just terrible,” Cohen <a href=#>quipped to <i>Vanity Fair</i></a> in January 2022, referring to the <i>Real Housewives</i> franchise. “If you look at the first few years of reunions, Orange County, Atlanta and New York, they were basically wearing — I don’t even think what they would wear to a cocktail party. I think it was more what they might wear to a PTA meeting.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>He continued: “I think people have loved seeing what they wear now. They were meant to be aspirational and that’s what they are. For the Housewives, getting ready for a reunion — this is <a href=#>like their prom dress</a>.”</p><p class=p1>At last month’s BravoCon, Cohen hosted the inaugural <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Bravos”</a> awards show — which included a trophy for the <strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong> Award for Chicest Bravolebrity. Kemsley, 47, <a href=#>ultimately presented it</a> to <i>The Real Housewives of Dubai</i>’s <strong>Chanel Ayan</strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5a7pcWMnKahnZ5it7C3xKxkoZ1dmbK0sdGvnKxlnZq6pnnTq5yarJ2au7V5xaipZpyimsC0tc2gZKWhm5p6r7%2FYp5po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
