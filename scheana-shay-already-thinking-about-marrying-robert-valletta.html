Also, it was revealed earlier this week that Scheana wanted to work through Mike’s infidelity. Yes, he apparently was getting flirty via text message with an unknown recipient.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>These days, Scheana has moved on from her tough relationship with Mike to Robert Valetta.&nbsp;</p><p>Scheana had previously dated Robert before things got serious with Mike. Now, Scheana has revealed that her views on marriage are <a href=#>very different now</a> from a few months back. &nbsp;</p><p>"If you asked me four months ago if I’d ever get married again, my answer was very different. I was like, ‘Hell, no. Never doing this again.’ And now I’m like, ‘I would love to marry him one day,’" Scheana said.</p><p>"I mean, we’re taking things very slow, but I wouldn’t be dating someone I don’t see a future with, because that’s just a waste of time at my age. So I definitely see a long future with him. Hopefully, he feels the same."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>It’s great that Scheana appears to be moving on with her life, but she seems to still be sticking to her rule about having no prenup.&nbsp;</p><p>"Even if I were to remarry, I’m still not about a prenup. Yeah, things didn’t go well with Shay and I, but I don’t regret not having a prenup because if I’m marrying someone, I trust them. They’re my best friend. They’re someone I’m gonna spend my life with," she explained.</p><p>"I mean, I know Katie described it as having insurance on your marriage, but I don’t think that’s something that I would need or want, because I do feel that puts a slight damper on the relationship. It’s like, well just in case, my money’s mine, and yours is yours."</p><p>If you <a href=#>watch Vanderpump Rules online</a>, you will already know that Katie Maloney compared a prenup to marriage insurance. She did have a point, but everyone is different.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Some people will want to take these precautions, while others are too blinded by love to think that anything is going to go wrong. Scheana did think it was something she would think about more next time.&nbsp;</p><p>"But we haven’t had this discussion. We’re not even close to being there," she said.</p><p>"I mean, if that’s something he wanted, then we would talk about it. But we’re two people who don’t really believe in that in general. So I wouldn’t recommend it, but if whoever I marry wanted it, then that’s a discussion we’ll have to have at that time."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>It sure sounds like a discussion they could be having soon enough.&nbsp;</p><p>What do you think about all of this?</p><p>Hit the comments below!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>13 Times Vanderpump Rules Was Like Mean Girls</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WBcL%2FCoZyappFiwKmt2GaYpaqVlrG6edOhoKejmaO0bq3BqKytZZ2Wv7PFyKeeZqqfl7KzwIyvmKWklanBons%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
