Kate Sloan was left heartbroken after breaking up with her boyfriend, and three days after their split found herself signing up for a 'four-handed erotic massage'.
Writing in MamaMia.com.au, Canadian 20-something Kate said: &#34;For many, this would be a blissful proposition – and it would be for me, too, if I wasn’t utterly gutted this week."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

What if I burst into tears on the massage table?"</p><p>Kate knew of one of the masseuses already through her work as a sex writer, and adds that she had been following Caitlin K Roberts' journey in 'erotic touch'.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000379976226.jpg><p>She claims that erotic massages can claim all sorts of physical and psychological ailments, "from premature ejaculation to pelvic pain to sexual trauma."</p><p>Upon arriving at Caitlin's apartment, Kate was also introduced to co-masseuse Cosmo Meens, who reassures her that "pleasure is our birthright".</p><p>The erotic massage itself takes place on a massage table in a spare room, where Kate lies down naked.</p><p>She said: "Narrating what they’re doing while they do it, Caitlin and Cosmo place their hands along the 'centre line” that runs down my chest and belly, and encourage me to breathe deeply and slowly.</p><p>"The central conceit of SexBod is that it’s all about what the client wants, at any given moment – so they check in with me steadily as they begin to trace light touches all over my body. 'How does that feel?' 'Is there anywhere that particularly wants to be touched?' 'How can we make this better for you?'</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000379976224.jpg><p>"It’s deeply affirming to me as a person who sometimes struggles to ask for particular things in my sex life. Never before have I felt so appreciated for simply requesting what I want.</p><p>"As Caitlin and Cosmo’s touch moves in a more carnal direction, focusing more on my breasts, thighs, and belly with a luxurious application of coconut oil, I have the thought: 'This is the first time I’ve felt turned on in days.'"</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">More sex stories</h2></p><p>Kate's was then brought to orgasm by the pair, before being wrapped in a warm towel and told to get dressed at her own pace.</p><p>She adds: "It’s only when the two of them leave the room that I finally burst into tears, after being afraid all day that I would cry during the massage. I feel cleansed.</p><p>"For a few minutes, I cry, silently, but hard enough that I can feel the massage table trembling beneath me. And then I get up, scrub the excess coconut oil off my skin with a towel Caitlin provided, and step back into my clothes.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nintchdbpict000379976222.jpg><p>After a short aftercare-y debrief in which Caitlin and Cosmo offer me chocolate and strawberries, chat with me a bit, and then hug me goodbye, I walk out into the August sunshine. There is – to use an enormous cliché – a spring in my step. It’s the first time in days that I’ve felt … happy. Effortlessly, uncomplicatedly happy.</p><p>"I feel grounded, embodied. I’m no longer afraid that my ex was the last person who’ll ever want me or give me pleasure, because I feel pleasured and desirable and he’s not even part of the equation."</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Read more of Kate's work on her website.</a></p><p>If you want more <a href=# rel=noopener>unconventional orgasm methods, meet the couple who reach dizzy heights of pleasure by simply HUGGING</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Erotic hypnosis has also been heralded as a way for women to orgasm</a> without being touched.</p><p>And this <a href=# rel=noopener>couple claim to have orgasms that last EIGHTEEN hours.</a></p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Holly Willoughby asks a woman if she orgasmed after claiming she had sex with a ghost</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jp%2BYm62cpMK0e5RscG9sZm18p7vUq2ShmZ6ZsqV5xKumraGTYrqiv9Kanp5n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
