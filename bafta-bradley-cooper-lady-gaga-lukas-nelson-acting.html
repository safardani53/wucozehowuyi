I think there was a lot of power behind both of them [<a href=#>Gaga</a> & Cooper] and they used their power in perfect combination to have that movie be successful.</p><p>"I learned a lot. I was glad to be part of it and wrote a lot of great songs, and I did realise that I'm happy I'm a musician, you know, there's a lot of waiting around in this industry."</p><p>That's not to say he didn't enjoy being part of such an iconic film; the 2018 version was the fourth remake in the film's storied history.</p><p>He continued: "I learned about Hollywood, the things I want and the things I didn't want in that world - in terms of Hollywood the industry. It was a strange and beautiful world I had not been a part of, and I'm lucky I was able to get in there and sort of get out and learn from it."</p><p>It shouldn't be understated how much of an impact Lukas had on the reboot.</p><p>Not only did he play the guitarist in <a href=#>Cooper's</a> hard living rocker Jackson Maine's band, but the lead character was also modelled on Lukas, who is the son of rock 'n' roll hall of famer <a href=#>Willie Nelson</a>.</p><p>Americana fan Bradley personally sought him out after watching him play guitar for Neil Young at the Desert Trip music festival in California.</p><p>It proved a genius decision as they, along with Gaga, combined perfectly for the moving soundtrack that was based, in part, on moments from Lukas's own life.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Celebrity</h2></p><p>Though Lukas hasn't acted since working on the film, he hasn't ruled out getting in front of the camera again if the circumstances are right.</p><p>He says: "I love creating and I can't stop, I'm always writing. I think as time goes by I'm sure that someone out there might want to use the songs I've written or to ask me to write a song or two for a film you know and I'd be happy to do it.</p><p>"If I end up acting it's got to be something that makes sense."</p><p>However, his immediate priority is the release of his and band Promise of The Real's eighth album Sticks and Stones on July 14.</p><p>The record will feature heavily in the group's June tour dates which begin in Oxford on the 13th.</p><p>The biographical set of songs were crafted with the audience in mind, and Lukas has promised plenty of anthemic choruses to sing along to.</p><p>He said: "The last record we did was really reflective and I just thought, well, I wanted to write songs that got people off their seats and in the mood to dance and really be merry.</p><p>"It was inspired by many different types of artists that are really great performers: my father [Willie Nelson], Bob Wills, Merle Haggard, the Bakersfield sound is really prevalent in like a Buck Owens type thing.</p><p>"It's a very country record in the sense of the type of country I really like. I wanted to make a full on country record that still had my little twists to it but that really paid tribute to the type of singing troubadour style music I grew up on.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"When this album comes out we'll be playing a lot of these new songs, which is great because they're designed for the live show. I could play this whole record all the way through and it'd be a great live show."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/35-p-m-et-features-816674494.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hwYWaCeISPaJmanqSWeqO%2BwJ2jnrFdmLywvMSrZKWZlK56qK3GmmSlrZuWwG66xKWqqKZdlrC1tc2gZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
