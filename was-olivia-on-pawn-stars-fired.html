Was Olivia fired?&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia Black was fired from 'Pawn Stars' after one of her photoshoots leaked.</h2><p>Olivia had to say goodbye to the cast and crew before her second season on Pawn Stars came to an end. She was fired after the National Enquirer leaked photographs from a shoot she did for SuicideGirls, a website and community promoting nude and pinup photography.</p><p>And it sounds like <a href=#>Pawn Stars head honcho Rick Harrison</a> didn't have much of a say in the decision. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fox News</a>, he offered Olivia the opportunity to continue working for the <a href=#>Gold & Silver Pawn Shop</a> — as long as she didn't appear in front of the cameras.&nbsp;</p><p>"I never fired her. She’s out doing her own thing now. It's just the production company did not want her working there anymore. What she does in her personal life ... is her business," Rick told Fox News.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Olivia said that she was too shocked to ask why she had to leave.&nbsp;</p><p>"I don't have the actual reason as to why I am not a part of the show anymore. They didn't state it, and I didn't ask — I was just in such shock I didn't think to ask," Olivia told Fox News.&nbsp;</p><p>As Olivia confirmed, she and the crew of the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop parted ways on amicable terms, with her deciding not to work there anymore.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Several petitions were launched on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Change.org</a> in the wake of Olivia's firing from Pawn Stars to bring her back. None of them were successful.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia has built a career as a model, content creator, and adult film star.</h2><p>After leaving Pawn Stars, Olivia resumed her work as an erotic model and social media influencer. She launched a YouTube channel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Miss Olivia Black</a>, in January 2013. She and her partner, Maria Plaza (aka the Bare Naked Chef), have created several videos together, including vlogs and workout tutorials.&nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Olivia and Maria appear to have stopped posting on YouTube over three years ago. They haven't shared updates on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">their website</a>, either. However, Olivia has stayed pretty active on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her own website</a>, where she shares her personal exclusive erotic content.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Olivia sued the producers of 'Pawn Stars' for wrongful termination.</h2><p>After being fired, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Olivia sued Leftfield Pictures</a>, the production company behind Pawn Stars. According to her publicist, &nbsp;Domenick Nati, Olivia believed that "this intolerance for online nude photos seems to be only subjected to female television personalities and because of that Olivia has been advised to sue the production company for discrimination."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Domenick revealed, "While getting ready for the night shift one day, Olivia received a phone call at her house from Leftfield Pictures, and with no further explanation, they informed her she will no longer be on Pawn Stars," shortly after the nude photos were uncovered. It's unclear what became of the lawsuit, which was originally filed in 2013.</p><p>Catch new episodes of Pawn Stars every Monday at 9 p.m. EST on History.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrK60ec6loK%2BhkWK8r3nPmq6nZaOprrO%2FjJ%2Bgq52U</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
