One of those plans is making Jay’s American dream come true. He now has his very own tattoo shop.
This week, Ashley Martson took to Instagram to make a very special announcement.

good news with an Instagram post of his own.</p><p>"As much as I enjoyed my time at Ego Ink with some amazing co-workers and boss," Jay’s caption begins.</p><p>He reveals: "I have made the decision to branch off on my own!"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto

announces.</p><p>He acknowledges that "This process has not been easy at all."</p><p>Jay put in a lot of work, "but my shop is now under a complete renovation and will hopefully open in a little over a month."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"Thanks to my wife and family for supporting me in this decision," Jay writes in tribute.</p><p>It is unclear if he means financial or emotional support, but fans conclude that it is likely both.</p><p>"And," Jay raves, "I can’t wait to see what the future holds."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>"I appreciate all the love and support from everyone," Jay writes.</p><p>Jay has his own very devoted fan base, like many 90 Day Fiance stars.</p><p>"And," Jay says, he "can not wait to begin this journey as a business owner."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I will be hiring 5 tattoo artists," Jay reveals.</p><p>"So," he writes, "if you’re in the area and looking for a

<a href=#>Ashley and Jay are really back together</a>, and they don’t seem to care if fans understand why.</p><p>After months of giving their marriage another shot, they are embarking upon business ventures together.</p><p>What’s remarkable is how very different things were for them just one year ago.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>After Jay’s third (of four) cheating scandal, Ashley went on vacation in June of 2019 with her family.</p><p>During that time, Jay allegedly broke into her home and removed some items.</p><p>Upon her return, Ashley discovered this and sought a protective order to prevent Jay from coming near her or her home.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>In early July of 2019, Jay for some reason mentioned the protective order in his Instagram Stories, violating the order and getting himself arrested.</p><p>As a result, he spent the vast majority of July of that year behind bars, in ICE custody because he is not a US citizen.</p><p>Jay was only released when his then boss — the owner of Ego Ink — paid thousands of his own money for Jay’s bail.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>We should note two things:</p><p>One, cash bail criminalizes poverty in the guilty and the innocent alike, and must end if we are to have a just society.</p><p>Two, the woman running up to Jay and leaping into his arms at this moment from late July 2019 is not Ashley, but Jay’s then-mistress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Ashley and Jay actually ended up getting back together after that, before Jay’s fourth cheating scandal included a side piece claiming to be pregnant.</p><p>She did not turn out to be pregnant, but it was enough for Ashley to beg him for a divorce.</p><p>Jay finally signed divorce papers in the final days of 2019 … only to write the wrong date, invalidating the documents and putting Ashley back in square one.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Jay refusing to grant Ashley the sweet release of the divorce for which she begged and pleaded appears to have paid off well for him.</p><p>He is now a business owner, and it appears that this won’t be their only venture.</p><p>But will their two other businesses be the lingerie line that Ashley teased weeks ago?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg><p>Apparently not, as Ashley revealed in the comments that she will be opening a salon and a makeup line.</p><p>We wish the best of luck to Ashley, to Jay, and to their future employees.</p><p>Tattooing is Jay’s passion, and we can’t wait to see how this business turns out!</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Ashley Martson to Amber Portwood: Shut Up About 90 Day Fiance, You Knife-Wielding Maniac!</h2></a><a
