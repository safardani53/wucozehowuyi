As of now, DeRosa is 45 years old.</p><p>This New Jersey native was born on February 26, 1975, under the sun sign of Pisces.</p><h2>Professional MLB Career</h2><p>In the 1996 Major League Baseball draft, Mark was picked by the Atlanta Braves in the seventh round and 212th overall.</p><p>Following that, he finally made his MLB debut on September 2, 1998, as a shortstop.</p><p>Until 2001, the young DeRosa passed as a backup utility player, where he played for both infield and outfield.</p><p>By 2002, he spent more time on the pitch and started as a third baseman in the early 2004 season.</p><p>However, his performance was criticized, and even Mark admitted to his poor performance.
