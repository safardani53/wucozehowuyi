The&nbsp;35-year-old singer has often been linked with several women.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>In 2018, when he and&nbsp;Duck Dynasty actress Sadie Robertson appeared together in his hit single 'The Long Way,' fans started speculating if they were&nbsp;dating each other.</p><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">According to The Sun</a><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>, she&nbsp;said, "Brett's amazing," to&nbsp;Entertainment Tonight at the time of their shoot. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She continued to speak about their companionship,&nbsp;saying, "We had the most fun that day. We just goofed off... he's a goober, he's hilarious. That started a friendship that will hopefully last a long time."</p><p>She elaborated, "Everybody thinks we're dating. We just had so much fun together. Everybody was like, 'No, you were really laughing.' We really were. We really did have a great time. But I don't know, girl, it's too complicated."</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>However, the rumor was never confirmed. Robertson later married&nbsp;Christian Huff in 2019 and subsequently <a href=# rel=follow>welcomed the pair's first child</a>,&nbsp;Honey James Huff. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Brett Eldredge Says Carly Pearce Is 'Awesome'</h2><p>In March, singer-songwriter&nbsp;Carly Pearce said that she was not looking to mingle — following her divorce from fellow country singer Michael Ray last year — while speaking in an interview with Gunner and Cheyenne.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>But when the&nbsp;pair asked her if she had any <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">interest in Eldredge</a>, she changed her previous response and said, "I mean listen, he would be my exception."</p><p>Gunner and Cheyenne soon met&nbsp;the&nbsp;country music singer and asked his thoughts&nbsp;on Pearce's comments. He responded to the question by saying that her remark&nbsp;was as awesome as she was. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>"That's awesome, she's awesome, that's amazing," he said while remembering his memories with her. He added, "She opened on tour when I was with Blake Shelton a few years back and is a great person and a great singer."</p><h2>Brett Eldredge Wants 'Soul Deep Kind of Person'</h2><p><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Speaking with Pop Culture</a> in March 2018, the singer expressed that his ideal girlfriend or his partner, so to say, would be a "soul deep kind of person" and someone with an amazing heart.</p><p>"What I'm kind of looking for is to find that soul deep kind of person, with an amazing heart that I could really get to know and probably take it slowly," he stated.</p><p>The famed singer further added, "Just kind of take the long way around the town—that's kind of where I am in life. So I'm definitely more open to it than I ever think I was, and I'm not afraid to talk about that."</p><p>His statement suggests that he is ready to dive into a serious relationship if he comes across his ideal partner.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqimsG1ecSlm6udlJyybsPIn5xnoKSiuQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
