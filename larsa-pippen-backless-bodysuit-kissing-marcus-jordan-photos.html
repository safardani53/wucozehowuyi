They also locked lips in front of the restaurant, with Michael holding his girlfriend by the waist, as seen below. Michael matched Larsa in an all-black ensemble of bleach-splattered jeans, a hoodie with the word “Gallery” emblazoned across it in black fabric, and a backward baseball cap. He wore white sneakers and accessorized with a silver watch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/larsa-pippen-marcus-jordan-backgrid-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>The couple’s date night came just days after Larsa revealed on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Real Housewives of Miami</a> Season 5 reunion that she would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>“definitely change” her last name</a> “for whomever” she marries in the future. Larsa was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>previously married</a> to former NBA star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Scottie Pippen</strong></a>, 57, between 1997 and 2021. Her and Marcus’ relationship has turned heads because Scottie played several seasons on the Chicago Bulls with Marcus’ father, Michael Jordan. However, Larsa claimed during the reunion that she barely knew the Basketball Hall of Fame inductee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/larsa-pippen-marcus-jordan-mega-embed-21.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>“I was with Scottie the very last year that he played with Michael,” she explained. “Michael and his wife were going through a divorce, so I never met his wife, never met his kids. It wasn’t like we had families that were intertwined. I never knew them.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Last month, the reality star <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>defended their 16-year age gap</a>&nbsp;during an appearance on the Tamron Hall Show.&nbsp;“I personally don’t really care what other people – I live my truth. I’m happy. We get along. I feel like [Marcus] is my best friend. We have a lot in common,” she said.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Larsa and Marcus were first <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted together in September</a> grabbing dinner in Miami. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Romance rumors</a> flew after they continued to publicly see each other and even <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>began holding hands</a> when out and about. In January, their relationship was confirmed. “It is still casual and they’re having fun,” an insider told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>PEOPLE&nbsp;</a>in January. “She’s trying her best to keep it quiet and not make a big deal out of it. They see each other at least a few times a week.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH10e5FpZqWZoqiubrzIqaeepl2XrqS3y56qrGWSpLG6v9Siq2ajmajAqrrGZqSaqpOqwG62zqubmqZdpbWwwM6sZg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
