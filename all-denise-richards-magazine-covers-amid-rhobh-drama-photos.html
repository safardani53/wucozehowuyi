There is no doubt about that,” she replied. “I was exhausted, emotional & felt everyone was coming at me. I got upset because I thought you of all people would get what I was saying because you yourself say you don’t get the glam thing and just wear a messy top knot. So I didn’t get the sudden change.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added: “With that said, I still regret that comment and was not the best version of myself that night.
