Directed by John Landis and costarring <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Eddie Murphy</a> and Jamie Lee Curtis, its story follows two men of different classes whose fortunes are reversed as part of an elaborate bet. Aykroyd played commodities broker Louis Winthorpe III, while Murphy, 62, played street hustler Billy Ray Valentine.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">At one point amid a revenge plot against the pair of wealthy brothers (played by Ralph Bellamy and Don Ameche) subjecting them to their cruel social experiment, Winthorpe disguises himself as a dreadlocked Jamaican, speaking in a stereotypical accent and wearing dark makeup.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy in Trading Places.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Photo courtesy Paramount</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Eddie and I were improvising there,” Aykroyd said, remembering the scene. “Eddie is a Black man and his entourage were all Black people, and I don’t think they batted an eye. There was no objection then; nobody said anything. It was just a good comic beat that was truthful to the story.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The actor continued, “In these days we’re living in, all that’s out the window. I would be hard-pressed to do an English accent and get away with it. They’d say, ‘Oh, you’re not English, you can’t do it.’ ”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aykroyd further reflected on Trading Places’ legacy 40 years later, calling the movie “right up there with It’s a Wonderful Life or A Christmas Story” as a winter holiday favorite.&nbsp;</p><p>Trading Places</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also confessed to eating real salmon covered in hair during a memorable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>scene</a> as a bearded Santa. “Of course I ate the salmon through the beard,” he told The Daily Beast. “Absolutely. Take after take, I can tell you.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In 2021, Aykroyd reflected on sensitivity in the comedy world today with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “You don’t have to go pulling any divisive cards to get a laugh,” he said. “There is so much in the world to comment on that is outside the realm of offensiveness. As a writer, you can go to other areas and have successful creative endeavors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“Who can be the subject of an impression today?” he continued. “That’s an area of discussion. Can I do my James Brown imitation? He was one of my best friends. I do his voice pretty good. But maybe I shouldn’t anymore.”</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Dan Aykroyd in 2019.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>Jean Baptiste Lacroix/WireImage</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Aykroyd will next appear onscreen in the still-untitled <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sequel</a> to 2021’s <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Ghostbusters: Afterlife</a>, which reunited him with the original 1984 film’s costars Bill Murray and Ernie Hudson.
