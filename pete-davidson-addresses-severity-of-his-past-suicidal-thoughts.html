The comedian got the help he needed and healed through making The King of Staten Island. “I really wanted this to be, like, cleansing for me. I feel like I got to speak about it in the biggest way possible, and I could get my story out there. So I feel like, now I could, like, let it go,” he explained.</p><p dir=ltr>Davidson cowrote The King of Staten Island alongside director&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Judd Apatow </strong></a>and <strong>Dave Sirus</strong>.

He got tattoos to cover up the subsequent scarring.</p><p dir=ltr>“Whenever you’re so manic and upset, sometimes [cutting is] the only thing that’ll work for me,” he said. “But you go to rehab, you learn like, ‘Oh, you take a cold shower, you can work out, you can listen to music really loud … you can call a friend. You can wait five minutes.’”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p dir=ltr>The King of Staten Island hits streaming platforms on Friday, June 12.</p><p dir=ltr>If you or someone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 for support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGapnaSaeqWt1aKbrKeeYq6lsNGeqqydo2LApsLEq6CtsV2ks260yKxkqZmjqXq0wcicoJ2ZnGLBqbvUoJ%2Btq18%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
