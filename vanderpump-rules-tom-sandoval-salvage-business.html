Tom's months-long affair with Raquel Leviss rocked the Vanderpump Rules cast and fans earlier this month after girlfriend Ariana Madix discovered an &#34;intimate video&#34; on his phone.
Apart from releasing an apology, the reality star has kept quiet and away from the public eye - except for a rare sighting of him at Raquel's apartment where he reportedly filmed a scene for Bravo."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But the thing that I'm enjoying about it is there seems to be an awareness out there," the Dumbass Whiskey founder spilled.</p><p>"More people are expressing an interest - whether it's positive or negative - I think that people are aware of the brand."</p><p>Peter also defended Schwartz, saying he's a "good guy" for not outing his best friend, if he did in fact know about Raquel, 28, and Tom's secret hook ups before it was made public.</p><p>"Well, I've always been been told, 'No PR is bad PR,' and I'm still on the fence as far as, you know, the question of, 'Is it a PR stunt that they're doing for the show?'" Peter added.</p><p>"I don't know. I'm not on the inside, so I'm not quite sure."</p><h2>SCHWARTZ & SANDY'S</h2><p>Apart from the whiskey brand, Sandoval is also a partial owner, along with bestie <a href=#>Tom Scwhartz</a>, at TomTom Restaurant & Bar and Schwartz & Sandy's in Los Angeles.</p><p>As noted in his apology, both of the restaurants are affected by the scandal.</p><p>Tom told his fans: "Schwartz & Sandy's might have my name on it, but also there are 3 other partners and 20 employees, who especially rely on the restaurant for income for them and their families.</p><p>"Just like TomTom, I'm a small part of a much bigger thing.</p><p>"Please direct ur anger towards me and not them."</p><p>The owner of Schwartz & Sandy's, Greg Morris, who is featured on this season of Vanderpump Rules, told The U.S. Sun in a statement that people have been spreading "hate messages" on platforms like Yelp and Google to prevent people from eating there.</p><p>"It is reckless, irresponsible and callous to call for the boycotting or making blatantly false allegations against a business that was not involved in these people's personal lives," Greg stated.</p><p>"This has taken a toll on a lot of people who have been honest and hardworking to make Schwartz & Sandy's a place that serves the community."</p><p>He continued: "Most of us [workers] are still reeling from the pandemic and have only tried to find a way back, we will continue our efforts to provide a place for people that come from a place of positivity and support."</p><h2>TOM'S COMEBACK</h2><p>Tom is expected to make an appearance at the season 10 reunion, which is expected to film on March 23.</p><p>The U.S. Sun previously reported that <a href=#>Raquel is most likely going to appear virtually</a>, rather than in person, per a source, given that she has a <a href=#>temporary restraining order</a> against castmate <a href=#>Scheana Shay</a>.</p><p>The source said the model is "taking the cowardly way out by blaming the legal matters on why she can't physically attend."</p><p>This will be <a href=#>the first time the cast will come together</a> in one room to face off on "Scandoval."</p><p>Ariana, 37, is the latest <a href=#>star who broke her silence</a>.</p><p>After the reunion films, Tom will be returning to tour with his band, <a href=#>Tom Sandoval & The Most Extras</a>.</p><p>Their first stop after taking a break is at The Canyon in Montclair, CA, on Friday, April 7.</p><p>Meanwhile, VPR fans can watch the drama unfold on new episodes of Vanderpump Rules ever Wednesday night on Bravo.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/ariana-madix-tom-sandoval-raquel-800089058-6.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/so-cringe-vanderpump-rules-fans-800334085.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2023/03/tom-sandoval-tom-sandoval-extras-707450404.jpg><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2hvZmmFc3yYaK2appSav7HBzKlkq62cmsBuwM6mZKyZnpm8t63LZqqapKaWtKZ5wa6qoqaVqMBw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
