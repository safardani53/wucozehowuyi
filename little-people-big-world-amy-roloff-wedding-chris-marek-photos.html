Sometimes it felt like the two clashed at times for me. But in the end, it’s about the two of us — Chris and I.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Amy-Roloff-Chris-Marek-married-tlc-post.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>Amy sweetly noted, “It’s about combining our two lives together into one and sharing it with our family and friends.”&nbsp;The pair got engaged in September 2019, on the three year anniversary of their first meeting at a pool party in 2016. It came one year after Amy filed for divorce from ex-husband <strong>Matt Roloff</strong>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“[Chris and I] got to talking and he invited me to go on a motorcycle ride,” Amy recalled in a December 2016 episode of Little People, Big World. “Oh, I’m having a ball!” She later revealed she never expected to fall in love with someone of average height. “I just never thought someone who is average size would be interested in me,” she said in a June 2017 episode of the TLC show. “I just really want him to never question or doubt the relationship because I’m a little person.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>As for her plans on the morning of the wedding, Amy told the outlet she would be doing some self-reflection, “I’m going to write in my journal and read some devotions,” she explained. “Write my vows. Look at photos of Chris and I and think about where we started to where we are now and how wonderful it has been.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH15e5FyZqWhpKm5pnnPnqappJVir6qzjLCmq6SUYq6uxYyrpqWnlpt6uLHDnaCnn12YtbO10makmqqVoHqxtM6tpqxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
