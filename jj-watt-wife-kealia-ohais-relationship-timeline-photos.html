The <a href=#>sports stars met</a> through Watt’s former <a href=#>Houston Texans</a> teammate <strong>Brian Cushing</strong>, who is married to Ohai Watt’s sister, <strong>Megan Cushing</strong>.</p><p>Speculation of the pair’s connection began after Watt was caught sporting the Chicago Red Stars player’s jersey number — No. 7 — during a press conference. Ohai Watt confirmed <a href=#>her romance with the football player</a> during an October 2016 episode of the “2 Up Front” podcast.</p><p>“The rumors are true. We are dating,” she revealed at the time. “I’ve known JJ for a really long time, and we’ve always been great friends.”</p><p>The professional athletes’ connection continued to grow deeper over the years. In May 2019, the defensive end <a href=#>got down on one knee</a> after three years of dating.</p><p>“I’m the luckiest man in the world. #SheSaidYes,” Watt captioned a series of photos from his proposal. The former Houston Dash Captain shared her own set of engagement photos, gushing, “Still can’t believe I get to be with you forever. I love you @jjwatt.”</p><p>Less than one year after getting engaged, the twosome <a href=#>tied the knot in a stunning destination wedding</a> in the Bahamas. “Best day of my life. Without question,” the Wisconsin native wrote via Instagram in February 2020 alongside a series of snaps from the couple’s special day.</p><p>Following their nuptials, the newlyweds were forced to postpone their honeymoon plans amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Watt later opened up about <a href=#>quarantining with his wife</a> as they adjusted to married life.</p><p>“[These past months have] been obviously different,” Watt said during a <a href=#>Today</a> interview in September 2020, adding that it was “great” to “spend a lot of time” with the Utah native. “I got married in February, so my wife and I, instead of being on a honeymoon, we got quarantined.”</p><p>After three months of lockdown, the athletes returned to their jobs to play in their respective bubbles. Ohai Watt rejoined her soccer team to play the season while in a bubble in Utah, while Watt returned to the NFL. He was released from the Houston Texans the following year and signed with the <a href=#>Arizona Cardinals</a> in March 2021.</p><p>In June 2022, the duo announced that <a href=#>they were expecting their first child</a>. They <a href=#>welcomed their son</a>, Koa, four months later.</p><p>“Love and happiness have reached heights we never even knew existed. Koa James Watt 10.23.22,” The proud parents wrote in a joint <a href=#>Instagram post</a> in October 2022, sharing a sweet snap of them cradling their newborn in the hospital.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Two months later, Watt announced <a href=#>his plans for retirement</a> with a sentimental message to his family. “Koa’s first ever NFL game. My last ever NFL home game,” <a href=#>he tweeted</a> in December 2022 alongside photos of his wife and child on the football field. “My heart is filled with nothing but love and gratitude. It’s been an absolute honor and a pleasure. 🙏🏼.”</p><p>Keep scrolling for Watt and Ohai Watt’s relationship timeline:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkt6t51pqrrWWnnrOmecqemKWhkWK8qa3IrGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdqbauscuipZ5loJ28tbvSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
