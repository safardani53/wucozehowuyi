I promised your father and I’ve tried my best to keep that promise and I love you to the moon and back. Always so proud of you. Love you.”</p><p>In June, Kim also gave a shout out to Jenner and her late biological dad, <a href=#>Robert Kardashian</a> on Father’s Day.</p><p>“Best to ever do it!” she wrote via Instagram alongside several photos of her growing up with both of her dads. “I wouldn’t be me if it weren’t for you two. Thank you. Happy Father’s Day.”</p><p>Following <a href=#>Jenner’s transition</a> in 2015, her relationships with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Kris Jenner</strong> </a>and some of her children and stepchildren have gone through many ups and downs.</p><p>In an April 2021 episode of<a href=#> Keeping Up With the Kardashians</a>, Kim and <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong> </a>opened up about their relationship with Caitlyn.</p><p>“I talk to Caitlyn every once in a while,” Kim explained at the time. “Definitely super supportive and checks in and stuff like that, but I’m just so busy.”</p><p>Khloé, 39, for her part, shared that she talks to Caitlyn <a href=#>“every blue moon,”</a> but there’s “no beef” between the duo. However, she added that when it comes to Kris, 67, she’s not sure if her mom is ready to be on good terms with her again.</p><p>“I just feel like that whole dynamic has been through so much,” Khloé admitted. “I think it’s taken Mom a really long time to get to where she is now emotionally and how she feels about everything, that I don’t know if Mom has anymore to give.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In October, the former Olympian revealed that she<a href=#> feels “sad”</a> that she and Kris no longer speak. (The twosome were married from 1991 to 2014 and share <a href=#><strong>Kendall</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a> together.)</p><p>“If there’s any communication, my manager kind of talks to her,” Caitlyn shared on the Wednesday, October 4 episode of U.K.’s This Morning. “Kris, I don’t really have any more contact with her. It’s kind of sad because we went through a lot.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZmpubq6jKOcp6aVp3qzscCcq6xlpKR6rLXMZqKaqpSWwKm1wKeqZpuforqmutNmmJunpal6qbHRaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
