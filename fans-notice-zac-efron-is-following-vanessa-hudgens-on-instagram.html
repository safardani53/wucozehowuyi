Although some fans are claiming the actor <a href=#>followed his former High School Musical costar</a> earlier this month, it remains unclear when exactly Efron added Hudgens to his following list.</p><p>Efron and Hudgens both rose to stardom <a href=#>after playing Troy Bolton and Gabriella Montez</a>, respectively,<a href=#> in Disney Channel’s hit High School Musical film</a> franchise. The duo, who played love interests on screen,<a href=#> took their romance outside of set</a> when they confirmed that they were dating in 2007.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Fans-Notice-Zac-Efron-Is-Following-Vanessa-Hudgens-on-Instagram-More-Than-a-Decade-After-Split-Details-154.jpg><p>At the time, the Hairspray star recalled <a href=#>sharing instant chemistry with Hudgens</a>. “For all of the partner things, me and Vanessa always got paired up,” Efron said during a 2007 interview with Disney, referring to his audition with the actress. “I was like, ‘They’re not trying us with other people.’ For some reason, we kept sticking around [for callbacks]. I don’t know what it was with Vanessa, but we kind of clicked from the very beginning.”</p><p>Hudgens later offered a glimpse at <a href=#>how her and Efron maintained a strong connection</a>, telling CosmoGirl in 2008, “If you really love someone, you shouldn’t have to work at it. You finish each other’s sentences and have the same sense of humor.”</p><p>Us Weekly confirmed in 2010 that <a href=#>the pair called it quits after three years</a> of dating. Efron revealed to The Hollywood Reporter in 2014 that he was no longer in contact with Hudgens.</p><p>The former couple raised eyebrows in 2022 when they both <a href=#>shared photos from individual visits to High School Musical</a>‘s East High.</p><p>“Don’t you… Forget about me ✊🏼,” the Lucky One star captioned an Instagram photo of him <a href=#>posing in front of the school in Salt Lake City</a> in July 2022.</p><p>One month prior, the Princess Switch star <a href=#>documented her own trip to East High</a>. “Do you remember in kindergarten how you’d meet a kid and know nothing about them, then 10 seconds later you’re playing like you’re best friends because you didn’t have to be anything but yourself?” she wrote alongside a video of her dancing in front of the school, quoting the first film.</p><p>Following their split, the Gigi performer moved on with <a href=#><strong>Austin Butler</strong></a> in 2011, and nine years later, Us confirmed the twosome had called it quits. Hudgens <a href=#>made her relationship with <strong>Cole Tucker</strong> official</a> in February 2021, and they <a href=#>announced their engagement</a> after two years of dating.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“It feels amazing. It’s so funny, I was talking about this with Cole. People are always like, ‘Does it feel different? [Do] things feel different [getting engaged]?’ That was always my question normally, but now I get to be asked it,” the Powerless alum told Today’s <a href=#><strong>Hoda Kotb</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jenna Bush Hager</strong></a> on Friday, April 14. “And you know what, it actually does. There’s a sense of security. You feel so safe. It’s the best thing ever. I love being a fiancée.”</p><p>Meanwhile, Efron has been linked to <a href=#><strong>Lily Collins</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Alexandra Daddario</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Halston Sage</strong></a>. He also dated model <a href=#><strong>Vanessa Valladares</strong></a> from 2020 to 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGafmZ6oeq%2B706KanmWqlrBuscWrpqdlmah6p7vLpaawoZ6ceretzZ6qrJldncKls8SnqmannmK2r7%2FTmp6rmZ1k</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
