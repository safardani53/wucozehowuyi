However, she quickly realized that she couldn’t really remember how to play it.</p><p>“I was really nervous when I first heard that, and then I prepared. I realized that I had to learn ‘Smelly Cat’ again,” the actress, 57, said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Friday, June 4. “I tuned my guitar and then realized I don’t know the chords. But I Googled it. All the chords were there. So, thank you world for posting the chords.”</p><p>She added that it was “great” playing alongside <a href=#><strong>Lady Gaga</strong></a>, who showed up to do a duet at Central Perk for the special. However, she couldn’t calm her nerves when it came time to actually perform.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lisa-Kudrow-Panicked-Ahead-Smelly-Cat-Performance-Friends-Reunion-0001.jpg><p>“I learned [the song] and then my throat closed. I was so panicked that I couldn’t get anything out,” the Comeback alum admitted. “I didn’t know what was going to happen, but it worked out.”</p><p>Kudrow has been open through the years about barely being able to play the guitar, with the exception of when <a href=#>she played Phoebe Buffay on the show</a>, which aired from 1994 to 2004. After the series finale, she never played it again.</p><p>“No, oh no. Absolutely not,” she told host <a href=#><strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong></a>. “Just for the show, for those 10 years and then I was done.”</p><p>During the special, the “Born This Way” singer, 35, joined Kudrow on the famous couch and asked if she could sing along. She then thanked the Web Therapy alum <a href=#>for portraying “the different one”</a> and letting fans know it was OK to be unique.</p><p>After filming the duet, Kudrow got choked up over the compliment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Lisa-Kudrow-Panicked-Ahead-Smelly-Cat-Performance-Friends-Reunion-0002.jpg><p>“That blew me away,” the Emmy winner said on Friday. “Also, coming from her — because my son was in grade school and all the kids were listening to Lady Gaga and her whole message was everyone be yourself and be you — That was amazing.”</p><p><strong>Ben Winston</strong>, who directed the special, opened up about securing Gaga for the event and why he felt like she was the perfect star to do the duet.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I told Lisa that I wanted a music performance and didn’t want it to be the theme song. I asked if she’d consider singing ‘Smelly Cat’ and she thought it would be fun but said she never really played guitar,” Winston told<a href=#> The Hollywood Reporter</a>. “We gave her a guitar to practice that morning. I gave her a list of three or four names of people I thought would be really great to duet with, but Gaga was, without question, my number one. And she loved the idea of Gaga. Because Gaga — and I don’t think she’d mind me saying — has some Phoebe spirit in her.”</p><p>He added that there is a “synergy” between Kudrow and the 12-time Grammy winner. “Gaga said yes in a heartbeat,” the producer added. “She was like, ‘I would love to perform in Central Perk with Lisa Kudrow.'”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKOiq5FiuLaw0aiuZp%2BfpLStscNmqqadnKHGbq%2FArWScoJ%2BnsbR5wKGcmpxdpLNustGinKeco2K%2FpsHNoqanZw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
