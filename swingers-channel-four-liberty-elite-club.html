I’m in charge of my life, and swinging is part of that life. The main thing is being in control of my sex life."</p><h2><strong>‘I got cravings for sex when pregnant’</strong></h2><p>Located just off the A5 near Rugby, Warks., Liberty Elite attracts up to 200 guests a night, and Valentine's Day is one of the biggest nights of the year.</p><p>Guests are vetted before they arrive and pay £20 membership a year as well as an entry fee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603820825.jpg><p>For engineer Justin and partner Hannah, they first began to get more adventurous two years ago when Hannah was pregnant with her second baby – and instead of food cravings she developed cravings for sex.</p><p>She said: “I just turned round to Justin and said ‘I fancy adding a third person in the bedroom department.”</p><p>Initially the couple joined a partner swapping website, and invited a woman over for some fun.</p><p>Justin explained: “Every time I came near they sort of pushed me away.”</p><p>Hannah added: “I did want him to get involved but I thought ‘I’m having my fun first’.”</p><h2><strong>‘We’ll be having sex with other people - what’s more romantic?’</strong></h2><p>Getting ready for their first night on the scene together, Justin said: “This Valentines Day we’ll be going and having sex with a load of other people – what could be more romantic?”</p><p>They both clearly had high hopes for the evening, with Justin saying: “We’d both be open to the idea of an orgy.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603820451.jpg><p>“The more people the better because it would make me feel more sexy,” Hannah agreed.</p><p>Surrounded by writhing couples, however, later on, the night didn't go exactly as planned.</p><p>Watching what appeared to be an orgy unfurling in front of her eyes in the playroom, an unhappy Hannah stormed away feeling left out, saying: “I feel like we’ve been kicked out.</p><p>“I don't know why I bother, because no one wants me... I just want to go home.”</p><p>While it seems like a sure thing to many people, club manager Chanelle says: “People shouldn’t come here expecting to get action because then you just get disappointed if it doesn’t happen.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/8a45b4d3-f925-4e2b-96d6-be847bd7b260.jpg><p>However, Hannah soon perked up after some reassuring words from Justin, and they got down and dirty together instead.</p><h2><strong>‘I’m here for a good time</strong>'</h2><p>Single ladies are known on the scene as ‘unicorns’, because they’re such a rarity.</p><p>But on this night there were two single women attending the club – exotic dancer Malika and florist Siobhan.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/1bc43c18-1ba6-4b7a-a070-bda30bd2ba11.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603820827.jpg><p>After a ten year controlling relationship, stunning Malika, who was all dressed up in red lingerie, turned her back on dating for good, saying: “Men – I don’t want one, I haven’t got time for one. I have trust issues because I’ve been treated so s**t by men.</p><p>“I’ve come alone so I can just do what the hell I want, when I want. I’m here to have a bloody good time.”</p><p>After hanging out in the hot tub with Siobhan and single man Martyn, she invited him back to her room for a night of passion.</p><h2><strong>‘It’s like lending your car out to someone’</strong></h2><p>The club is open to all age ranges, and experience levels.</p><p>Husband and wife Simon and Carolyn have been married 13 years, swinging for four, and it was their second visit to Liberty when filming took place.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603820831.jpg><p>Bisexual Carolyn said: “Some people might think this is an odd way to spend Valentine’s Day but we’re not ordinary people.”</p><p>However, the couple opted for a laid back approach to their evening, and after getting to know fellow club-goers, they chose to just go home together.</p><p>Swinging is a way of life.</p><span class=quote-credit>John, Liberty Elite owner</span><p>Simon said: “This is more a roll of a dice. We don’t have to play if we don’t want to and it’s nice to be picky.”</p><p>Carolyn agreed, saying: “I’m sharing my husband with people – it’s like lending your car out to someone, you wouldn’t let just any old stranger drive around the block in it.”</p><h2><strong>‘It’s like visiting a tennis club’</strong></h2><p>Cashing in on peoples’ erotic desires is 78-year-old club owner John, who has been divorced since 1974, and still has sex two or three times a week.</p><p>He’s been on the swinging scene himself since the sixties, and said: “The two main hobbies in my life – one is making money, the other is young ladies, or ladies – which I’m very passionate about.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/NINTCHDBPICT000603820452.jpg><p>“Swinging is a way of life. I’m not sure anybody was designed to just have sex with one person for the rest of their life.</p><p>“It can be quite daunting for first timers – it’s exactly the same as visiting your local tennis club. When you first go in you wonder who you’re going to have a game of tennis with, who to have a drink with, and what to do.”</p><h2><strong>‘One woman had sex with 18 partners in one night’</strong></h2><p>While sex is the main attraction to a night like this, the club ensures guests are relaxed and well looked after, and halfway through the night they’re all treated to a finger buffet, consisting of snacks such as salmon sandwiches and cocktail sausages.</p><p>As well as a swanky bar, spa and playroom with multiple beds set up, the club also boasts 12 four-star hotel rooms, costing £60 a night, which is where Hannah and Justin opted to stay.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/12fc5163-aa3e-4c91-a332-b405945524dc.jpg><p>Manager Chanelle said: “People do have a misconception of what a swingers’ club is like. Dirty, old men just perving over women. They’re quite surprised when they walk straight into a posh wine bar.</p><p>“We do have some ladies who go to the extreme. I know one lady who’s had 18 in a night. Don’t ask me how – I have no idea.”</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE IN TV</h2></p><p>However, while staff insist its worlds away from the seedy image some people would have in their head, the clean-up operation the next day threw up some questionable finds – including a used condom mixed in with the dirty laundry.</p><p>Not that housekeeper Diane let that bother her.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>While washing the 250 towels and 60 sheets, she shrugged: “It’s no different to changing your own beds… the only thing is you’ve got an accumulation of different DNA.”</p><p><strong>Swingers is available to watch on All 4.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZn91hJFxb2tno6y2r7PEq6pmm5iWu6%2Bxy2adqK2iYrmqrsSrq7JllaG2tbGMnKOuml8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
