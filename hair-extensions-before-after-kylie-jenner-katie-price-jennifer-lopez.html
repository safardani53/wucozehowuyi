"My real hair is back to brown and I wear extensions but I wear it in a pony tail because my actual hair is so broken that it looks absolutely ratchet and absurd when I let it down."</p><p>In 2018, Ariana put rumours to rest about whether her pony tail was "real" when she filmed herself tossing her extensions on the floor of her London hotel room.</p><h3>Katie Price</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000631349108-2.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000628962399.jpg><p>Earlier this year, <a href=#>Katie Price exclusively revealed to The Sun that'd she removed 500 hair extensions</a> and unveiled her sleek shorter do.</p><p><a href=#>Katie</a>, 42, said: "I've finally had my extensions out and I wanted it cut off to get rid of all the dead ends and get the condition back.</p><p>"I have wigs if I want to experiment through lockdown, but this gives my hair a rest!"</p><p>In our exclusive pictures, Katie revealed her healthy, natural hair is a deep, brunette shade.</p><h3>Kim Kardashian</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000622539287.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000628999129-1.jpg><p>Like her younger sister Kylie, Kim often changes the length of her hair depending on her mood.</p><p>In a 2018 YouTube tutorial, Kim explained how she braids the shorter hairs on either side of her face all the way to the back of her head so the extensions blend in with her natural locks.</p><p>Earlier this year, the mum-of-four underwent another dramatic hair transformation and swapped her darker locks for "bronde" hair extensions.</p><h3>Jennifer Lopez</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/fbd174db-58bc-4c6a-9c87-7ba18bf3c3c0.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000635152902.jpg><p><a href=#>Jennifer Lopez</a> looked like a modern-day Rapunzel when she showed off her new blonde extensions on Instagram last October.</p><p>The star's hairstylist - who used extensions to create the look - also shared the photo on social media and wrote: "New hair vibes today."</p><h3>Halle Berry</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000257343622.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000340359914.jpg><p>As one of Hollywood's biggest stars, <a href=#>Halle Berry</a> is no stranger to hair extensions too.</p><p>After rocking short pixie cuts in the noughties, Halle has since dabbled with extensions and said she enjoys them because they're not as high maintenance as her natural curls.</p><p>She previously said: "I could just wash and go [with them]."</p><h2>How much do hair extensions cost?</h2><p>Naturally, the prices of hair extensions depend on how many you require and what length they are.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Different types of hair extensions:</h3></p><p><strong>Taped</strong></p><p>Special hair tape is used for extensions that are bonded to the hair for up to ten weeks.</p><p>After they have been applied, it's important not to wash your mop for three days to prevent the adhesive losing its tackiness.</p><p>Although you don't have to go through the lengthy process of clipping these strands in every day, you cannot remove them for two weeks if you decide you don't like them.</p><p>Some hair experts are also concerned that the taping process can cause damage to your hair.</p><p><strong>Clip-ins</strong></p><p>These extensions are applied using snap on clips and you don't need professional help to stick them in.</p><p>With this option, you can pick and choose when to wear them.</p><p>Depending on your mood, you can also decide how thick you want to make your barnet.</p><p>This is also a long-lasting option, as you can keep hold of the tresses as long as you look after them.</p><p><strong>Weave</strong></p><p>This method, also known as hair integration, can be used to add length and fullness.</p><p>It can be completed using bonding, fusion or micro rings.</p><p>For bonded extensions, the strands are sewn in under a layer of hair.</p><p>The fused technique glues the individual locks in, which is why the entire process can take more than three hours.</p><p>Micro rings are sometimes used to attach the tresses, which involves fixing small sections of hair using metal beads or hoops.</p><p>You can order hair extensions for as little as Â£35 online.</p><p>But in high-end salons, they can cost up to Â£800.</p><p>Customers can choose synthetic or real hair - human locks are generally considered to be the more luxury option and you could expect to splash out around Â£100 for a full head.</p><h2>Are hair extensions safe?</h2><p>Just like with any hair styling process, you run the risk of damaging your natural mop by getting any form of extensions.</p><p>The weight of the added locks can put stress on your roots.</p><p>In extreme cases, this can lead to your hair being pulled out.</p><p>To avoid this, always ensure that the extensions are placed on the strongest part of the strands on your head.</p><p>This means that placing clip-ons or tape at the hairline or nape of your neck is a no-no.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Vote for your Fabulous Mum of the Year and WIN</h3></p><p>Do you know a mum who deserves some extra recognition?
