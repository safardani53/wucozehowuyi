Not only did Claire (<strong>Caitriona Balfe</strong>) make a huge announcement in the show’s final minutes, Scottish dreamboat Jamie Fraser (<strong>Sam Heughan</strong>) was raped by his arch nemesis, Captain Jack Randall (<strong>Tobias Menzies</strong>). Read below for details about the ultra-disturbing scene, plus what lies ahead for everyone’s favorite 18th century duo.</p><p><strong>Claire Saves Jamie — With A Bunch of Cattle</strong></p><p>After plotting and scheming to save her man from Wentworth Prison, Claire and her band of kilted bros stormed the prison’s dungeons with a herd of cattle — flattening Randall in the process. The combination of adorable cows plus a jaunty Scottish jig would have been enough to illicit chuckles if it weren’t for Jamie, who the gang found naked and immobile on the floor after being raped by Randall.</p><p><strong>Claire and Jamie Reunite, It Gets Weird</strong></p><p>Claire and Jamie’s reunion wasn’t exactly filled with sunshine, rainbows, and tartan skirts. Claire struggled to set a visibly traumatized Jamie at ease as he recovered in a local monastery, but he refused to eat, suffered delusions (he thought Claire was Randall — the horror), and decided life wasn’t worth living. Turns out he had good reason for being so distraught.</p><p><strong>Jamie’s Rape Scene</strong></p><p>In a series of flashbacks, viewers watched Randall get drunk and rape Claire’s husband in an incredibly graphic scene. First, Randall washed Jamie and commented on the fact that he’s a magnificent creature (literally cannot with the creepy-factor), and then he quickly proceeded to assault him. The details of the scene don’t need to be described in depth, but Jamie eventually broke down and agreed to brand himself with Randall’s initials. Suffice it to say it was hard to watch what might be the most graphic depiction of male sexual assault (or assault in general) on television.</p><p><strong>Claire Leads Jamie “Back Into The Light”</strong></p><p>Claire was understandably traumatized by Jamie’s suicidal thoughts, so she confronted him about what really happened with Randall. At first Jamie resisted, but he eventually told the truth: he was broken down to the point of having non-resistant sex with Randall — partially because Randall convinced a delusional Jamie that he was Claire. “I couldn’t help myself,” Jamie told his wife. “It felt so good not to be in pain.”</p><p>After this revelation, Jamie decided he could no longer live, so Claire threatened to kill herself (Romeo and Juliet style). This horrifying reality finally snapped Jamie out of it, so he rid himself of the terrible experience the only way he knew how: cut off his branded skin, threw it in a fire, and spat on it. Bye forever.</p><p><strong>Jamie and Claire Head To Paris</strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Looking ahead, Jamie and Claire exchanged their kilts for berets and booked it over to Paris, where the Mackenzie clan had some connections. The plan? To change the future (good luck with that, friends) and have a baby. Part two is on track, since the end of the hour revealed that Claire’s pregnant with Jamie’s child. Frankly, it was a huge relief to have some good news after such an intense and devastating episode.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: What did you think of the finale?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKaurJyWu6Wx0WadoqaRobJuv8eomqSdomK3ornInmSfqpGosrN5yKxkq5mgmrFuvsSam2asmJp6s7HCmqdmamBmgnR8lGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
