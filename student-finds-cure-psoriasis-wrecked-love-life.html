Five years ago Eleanor Cartwright, now 23, had perfect skin but when she developed psoriasis after a bout of tonsillitis her self confidence plummeted.
The biomedical sciences student was covered in scaly red patches within two weeks of the illness and nothing she was prescribed cleared up her itchy skin condition."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

a young woman my psoriasis prevented me doing a lot, I was struggling with self consciousness and didn’t go out with my friends socialising as it was so bad."</p><p>Within months of using the cream Eleanor saw a a difference in her skin.</p><p>"Now I am happy to go makeup free once again which is something I never thought would happen," she said.</p><p>"I still have a couple of bits on my cheeks but I’m fine with that now.</p><p>"During university I had been seeing someone for a few months but when my skin hit a bad patch I just felt too self-conscious and I hit rock bottom and that feeling was the turning point for me, I said to myself I had to get this sorted before even thinking about getting close to a guy again, I just dropped dating altogether.”</p><p>"After that I just didn’t even bother with a social life or&nbsp; a love life- I left the house for lectures for hockey practice and that was it."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000377524099.jpg><p>"Two to three month into using MooGoo and my skin clearing up I braved downloading Tinder to ease myself back into dating.</p><p>"I met my now boyfriend of two and a half years and as they say, the rest is history."</p><p>According to the British Association of Dermatologists there is no cure for psoriasis.</p><p>"Treatment of psoriasis depends upon your individual circumstances," according to the associations website.</p><p>"It may be that you find that treatment applied to the surface of the skin (topical treatment) is sufficient to treat your psoriasis.</p><p>"For people with more extensive or difficult to treat psoriasis, light treatment (phototherapy), tablet treatment or injection treatment may be required.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">MORE ON PSORIASIS</h2></p><p>"The aims of topical psoriasis treatment are to remove excess scaly skin and calm the underlying inflammation.</p><p>"This will improve the appearance and help the skin feel more comfortable and less itchy.</p><p>"Different treatments are often used at different body sites and for some areas such as the scalp, a combination of treatments are needed to get the best results."</p><p>The most common form of topical psoriasis treatment is emollient moisturisers and creams containing vitamins A and D.</p><p>MooGoo's Skin Milk Udder Cream was formulated after founder Craig Jones's mother used an old fashioned country remedy to manage her skin condition.</p><p>The lotion was used by dairy farmers to keep cows' udders soft and supple but has now been changed for human use.</p><p><b>We pay for your stories!
