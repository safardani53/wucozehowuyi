After cohost<strong> Sisanie Reategui</strong> noted that she wanted to go back and watch their old reality shows, Spelling, 47, warned, “Watch Tori and Dean. Not True Tori.”</p><p>Garth, 48, subsequently asked, “<a href=#>Do you regret doing that show?</a>”</p><p>“I don’t regret the first season. I regret the second season, which you told me not to do. And you were right on,” the sTORI Telling author replied. “Because it shouldn’t have been a series. It wasn’t a series. It was about me expressing myself at a moment in time where I felt like I wanted to have a voice and a voice for women everywhere who were going through what I was going through at the time. It should have been a self-contained, one season and that was it.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tori-Spelling-Admits-Season-2-of-True-Tori-Was-a-Train-Wreck.jpg><p>True Tori, which aired for two seasons on Lifetime in 2014, followed the fallout of McDermott’s affair. Us Weekly<a href=#> broke the news in December 2013</a> that the Canadian actor cheated on Spelling with then 28-year-old Emily Goodhand while on location shooting Chopped Canada.</p><p>“It was great, it was really well-done and groundbreaking,” Spelling said of season 1 on Monday. “The second season was just silly. Only your best friend will tell you the truth. … It was a train wreck.”</p><p>McDermott was candid about <a href=#>how hard it was to film the series while it was airing.</a></p><p>“I can’t keep opening a vein, opening my soul and sharing my feelings and thoughts and demons with the world. I don’t watch it. I can’t. It’s really difficult. I can’t do it anymore, for my soul,” he told Access Hollywood at the time.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tori-Spelling-Dean-McDermott-Tori-Spelling-Admits-Season-2-of-True-Tori-Was-a-Train-Wreck-01.jpg><p>Years later, McDermott, who checked into treatment for mental health and sex addiction after the scandal, told Us that he felt like <a href=#>True Tori put their marriage “under the microscope.”</a></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I thought that Tori was just going to run for the hills, and I could totally understand why. But she was like, ‘I just can’t turn off the love for you. I love you. You hurt me. I’m angry, but I love you. I can’t turn that off,’” he said in October 2019. “Every relationship is work, and when you get to that point, you can’t bail. You got to knuckle under and work it out. It is hard.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Tori-Spelling-Dean-McDermott-Tori-Spelling-Admits-Season-2-of-True-Tori-Was-a-Train-Wreck.jpg><p>Spelling and McDermott were both married to other people when they met on the set of made-for-TV movie Mind Over Murder in 2005. They wed less than a year later and went on to welcome five kids: Liam, 14, Stella, 12, Hattie, 9, Finn, 8, and Beau, 4.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuoqpliwLGxy6Wgp59dlrGutdOsZKydkai8r3mRZqafZaSnwqZ506ipomWnlsBurYytqZqhnmLEs7HCpGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
